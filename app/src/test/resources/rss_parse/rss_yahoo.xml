                District judge Jack Robison interrupted jurors’ deliberations to say they should not
                convict 32-year-old Gloria Elizabeth Romero Perez. Judge Robison then reportedly
                recused himself for the remainder of proceedings. Perez, of Buda, Texas, was
                convicted anyway on one count of continuous traffic of a person and jailed for 25
                years, the site said.

                District judge Jack Robison interrupted jurors’ deliberations to say they should not
                convict 32-year-old Gloria Elizabeth Romero Perez. Judge Robison then reportedly
                recused himself for the remainder of proceedings. Perez, of Buda, Texas, was
                convicted anyway on one count of continuous traffic of a person and jailed for 25
                years, the site said.

                </a>
                Kazakhstan&apos;s quarter-century struggle to assert its autonomy from former
                overlord Russia has hit an unlikely snag: the lowly apostrophe. A vast but sparsely
                populated country wedged between Russia and China, Kazakhstan came under the rule of
                its northern neighbour as Russia and Britain jostled for control of Central Asia in
                the Great Game. It also came under its linguistic influence, and to this day, many
                Kazakhs speak more Russian than their Turkic native tongue. This became especially
                concerning after Russian state media, which remain popular in Kazakhstan, helped
                whip up Russian-speaking separatists to fight government forces in Ukraine in 2014.
                In April, Kazakhstan&apos;s president of 27 years, Nursultan Nazarbayev, ordered the
                government to prepare a new Kazakh alphabet based on Latin characters and ditch the
                one based on Russia&apos;s Cyrillic script, which the Soviets implemented in 1940.
                He has said this will give Kazakhstan “real independence” and help it join the
                “information world”. But a cumbersome version of the new alphabet chosen by Mr
                Nazarbayev last autumn has sparked rare dissent in this authoritarian country due to
                its ample apostrophes. Of 32 letters in the alphabet, nine are written with an
                apostrophe. Mr Nazarbayev meets with Vladimir Putin in December. He has tried to
                gently assert Kazakhstan&apos;s independence from its former overlord Credit:
                Alexander Nemenov/Pool Photo via AP An “against apostrophes” hashtag soon appeared
                on social media. So did a “No to Kazakh Latinisation with apostrophes!” Change.org
                petition in October, which was briefly blocked. Film director Saken Zholdas made a
                video explaining how inconvenient the apostrophes were. “With this decision, we are
                unintentionally, or maybe intentionally, killing the brand of Kazakh language once
                and for all,” he said. The problem lies in the need to differentiate related but
                distinct Kazakh sounds, such as a long and short “a,” or consonants similar to “s”
                and “sh”. Setting them apart with an apostrophe allows the alphabet to be typed on a
                standard Latin keyboard, but also produces odd flurries of punctuation and many
                eyesore words. For instance, the word for “bottle,” pronounced “shisha,” is written
                “s&apos;i&apos;s&apos;a”, while “east,” pronounced “shyghys,” becomes “s&apos;yg&apos;ys”.
                Those are hardly the worst: The word for “skier” will be “s&apos;an&apos;g&apos;ys&apos;y”
                and that for “crucial” will be “s&apos;es&apos;u&apos;s&apos;i”. The Republic of
                Kazakhstan will be written “Qazaqstan Respy’bli’kasy”. The palace of peace and
                reconciliation designed by Norman Foster in Astana, Kazakhstan Credit: Sergei
                Bobylev/&#92;TASS via Getty Images Some have speculated that Mr Nazarbayev picked
                the apostrophes to keep Kazakh distinct from the Latinised alphabets of other Turkic
                languages and placate Russia, which since Soviet times has feared pan-Turkic
                movements along its southern border. “The guy just liked it, and since our country
                is this way, no one in government can tell the president no,” Aidos Sarym, a
                political analyst who previously served on a state working group on Latinisation,
                told The Telegraph. Last month, Mr Nazarbayev said while the new apostrophes had
                caused “much discussion,” this version was the right one because it suited computer
                keyboards. But at the same time it complicates web searches and social media
                hashtags, where an apostrophe between letters splits them into separate words. “From
                a technical point of view, apostrophes create more problems than they solve,” said
                political analyst Dosym Satpayev. Mr Nazarbayev appears with Donald Trump in the
                White House on Tuesday. He has tried to balance relations with the United States,
                Russia and China Credit: Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg In his video, Mr
                Zholdas suggested replacing the apostrophes with accent marks over the nine letters
                in question, a move he said could be supported by 70 per cent of computer fonts.
                Despite the defence of his version in December, Mr Nazarbayev also said there was

                </a>
                Kazakhstan&apos;s quarter-century struggle to assert its autonomy from former
                overlord Russia has hit an unlikely snag: the lowly apostrophe. A vast but sparsely
                populated country wedged between Russia and China, Kazakhstan came under the rule of
                its northern neighbour as Russia and Britain jostled for control of Central Asia in
                the Great Game. It also came under its linguistic influence, and to this day, many
                Kazakhs speak more Russian than their Turkic native tongue. This became especially
                concerning after Russian state media, which remain popular in Kazakhstan, helped
                whip up Russian-speaking separatists to fight government forces in Ukraine in 2014.
                In April, Kazakhstan&apos;s president of 27 years, Nursultan Nazarbayev, ordered the
                government to prepare a new Kazakh alphabet based on Latin characters and ditch the
                one based on Russia&apos;s Cyrillic script, which the Soviets implemented in 1940.
                He has said this will give Kazakhstan “real independence” and help it join the
                “information world”. But a cumbersome version of the new alphabet chosen by Mr
                Nazarbayev last autumn has sparked rare dissent in this authoritarian country due to
                its ample apostrophes. Of 32 letters in the alphabet, nine are written with an
                apostrophe. Mr Nazarbayev meets with Vladimir Putin in December. He has tried to
                gently assert Kazakhstan&apos;s independence from its former overlord Credit:
                Alexander Nemenov/Pool Photo via AP An “against apostrophes” hashtag soon appeared
                on social media. So did a “No to Kazakh Latinisation with apostrophes!” Change.org
                petition in October, which was briefly blocked. Film director Saken Zholdas made a
                video explaining how inconvenient the apostrophes were. “With this decision, we are
                unintentionally, or maybe intentionally, killing the brand of Kazakh language once
                and for all,” he said. The problem lies in the need to differentiate related but
                distinct Kazakh sounds, such as a long and short “a,” or consonants similar to “s”
                and “sh”. Setting them apart with an apostrophe allows the alphabet to be typed on a
                standard Latin keyboard, but also produces odd flurries of punctuation and many
                eyesore words. For instance, the word for “bottle,” pronounced “shisha,” is written
                “s&apos;i&apos;s&apos;a”, while “east,” pronounced “shyghys,” becomes “s&apos;yg&apos;ys”.
                Those are hardly the worst: The word for “skier” will be “s&apos;an&apos;g&apos;ys&apos;y”
                and that for “crucial” will be “s&apos;es&apos;u&apos;s&apos;i”. The Republic of
                Kazakhstan will be written “Qazaqstan Respy’bli’kasy”. The palace of peace and
                reconciliation designed by Norman Foster in Astana, Kazakhstan Credit: Sergei
                Bobylev/&#92;TASS via Getty Images Some have speculated that Mr Nazarbayev picked
                the apostrophes to keep Kazakh distinct from the Latinised alphabets of other Turkic
                languages and placate Russia, which since Soviet times has feared pan-Turkic
                movements along its southern border. “The guy just liked it, and since our country
                is this way, no one in government can tell the president no,” Aidos Sarym, a
                political analyst who previously served on a state working group on Latinisation,
                told The Telegraph. Last month, Mr Nazarbayev said while the new apostrophes had
                caused “much discussion,” this version was the right one because it suited computer
                keyboards. But at the same time it complicates web searches and social media
                hashtags, where an apostrophe between letters splits them into separate words. “From
                a technical point of view, apostrophes create more problems than they solve,” said
                political analyst Dosym Satpayev. Mr Nazarbayev appears with Donald Trump in the
                White House on Tuesday. He has tried to balance relations with the United States,
                Russia and China Credit: Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg In his video, Mr
                Zholdas suggested replacing the apostrophes with accent marks over the nine letters
                in question, a move he said could be supported by 70 per cent of computer fonts.
                Despite the defence of his version in December, Mr Nazarbayev also said there was
                still time to “work with the new alphabet” before the country switches over fully in
                2025, giving hope that he could eventually relax his stance. “He wants to go into
                history … as the father of the new Latin Kazakh alphabet,” Mr Sarym said. “You can

                there aren&apos;t problems now, and so that tomorrow we won&apos;t have to do an
                upgrade.”

                Turkey on Saturday launched a new air and ground operation to oust a Kurdish militia
                from their northern Syrian enclave, defying US warnings that the action risked
                further destabilising the area after almost seven years of civil war. President
                Recep Tayyip Erdogan had repeatedly vowed that Turkey would root out the "nests of
                terror" in Syria of the People's Protection Units (YPG) militia which Turkey deems a
                terror organisation. Turkey's army said operation "Olive Branch" began at 1400 GMT
                and was aimed at the YPG and Islamic State (IS) jihadists.

                Authorities seized two healthy dogs from the Turpin family after 13 siblings were

                Donald Trump’s face on a stack of German newspapers: PsBattle: Trump screaming in a
                stack of newspapers from photoshopbattles The viral image was actually part of an
                advertising campaign for the Der Tagesspiegel newspaper back in 2016, reports

                On Friday, Trump was to become the first sitting president to address the March for
                Life. Donald Trump will host a lavish celebration of his first year as US president
                at his private estate in Florida on Saturday, with tickets starting at $100,000 a
                pair, even as thousands of women take to the streets to protest against his divisive
                leadership. Trump had been due to depart Washington on Friday but postponed the trip
                for a day as the government stood on the brink of its first shutdown since 2013.

                The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday blocked a lower court's order for North Carolina
                to rework its congressional map because Republicans violated the Constitution by
                drawing electoral districts intended to maximize their party's chances of winning.
                The conservative-majority court granted a bid by Republican legislators in North
                Carolina to suspend the Jan. 9 order by a federal court panel in Greensboro that
                gave the Republican-controlled General Assembly until Jan. 24 to come up with a new
                map for U.S. House of Representatives districts.

                Countering China and Russia is a bigger focus for US national security than
                defeating terrorism, the American administration announced yesterday. Donald Trump’s
                new national defence strategy named “inter-state strategic competition” as its
                primary concern rather than jihadist attacks. It marks a tipping point after almost
                two decades when the US has focussed on countering terrorism following the September
                11 attacks. China, Russia, North Korea and Iran were all mentioned as powers that
                were threatening the international order. The strategy signals a return of a Cold
                War-style mentality in American foreign policy that will focus on countering rival
                great powers. James Mattis, US Secretary of Defense Credit: EPA/WALLACE WOON James
                Mattis, the US defence secretary, explained the rationale behind the 11-page
                national defence strategy in a speech on Friday. “We will to continue to prosecute
                the campaign against terrorists that we’re engaged in today, but great-power
                competition - not terrorism - is now the primary focus of US national security,” he
                said. Mr Mattis added: &quot;To those who would threaten America&apos;s experiment
                in democracy: they must know if you challenge us, it will be your longest and worst
                day.&quot; The document itself included a similar message: “Inter-state strategic
                competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in US national security.” It
                called out threats posed by rival nations. “China is a strategic competitor using
                predatory economics to intimidate its neighbours while militarising features in the
                South China Sea,” it read. US President Donald Trump, right, and Russia&apos;s
                President Vladimir Credit: APEC-SUMMIT “Russia has violated the borders of nearby
                nations and pursues veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions
                of its neighbours. “As well, North Korea’s outlaw actions and reckless rhetoric
                continue despite United Nation’s censure and sanctions. &quot;Iran continues to sow
                violence and remains the most significant challenge to Middle East stability.” John
                McCain, the Republican senator of Arizona, welcomed the strategy, saying: “It gets
                the big decisions right, prioritises the threats we face, and offers clear guidance
                for making tough choices.” Mr Mattis also called on Democrats to agree new funding
                ahead of a midnight Friday deadline, warning that the military would suffer if they
                blocked budget proposals. Appealing to Congress, he said: &quot;No strategy can
                survive without predictable funding. As hard as the last 16 years have been, no
                enemy has harmed the US military more than defence spending caps and sequestration.&quot;
                Mr Trump cancelled his trip to Florida on Friday in an attempt to help avoid a
                government shutdown as Republicans piled pressure on their political opponents. The
                US president was due to fly to his Mar-a-Lago resort but stayed in Washington as
                scrambled negotiations played out behind the scenes. A fierce blame game erupted in
                the American capital as political rivals pointed the finger at each other over who
                was at fault. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, accused
                Democrats of being unpatriotic by threatening to block a funding extension. “The
                American people, the citizens who actually elected us, will be watching,&quot; he
                said. &quot;They will see which senators make the patriotic decision, stand up for
                the American people and vote to continue government funding.&quot; Chuck Schumer,
                the most senior Democrat in the Senate, noted that Mr Trump once said that America
                could use “a good shutdown”.

                violence and remains the most significant challenge to Middle East stability.” John
                McCain, the Republican senator of Arizona, welcomed the strategy, saying: “It gets
                the big decisions right, prioritises the threats we face, and offers clear guidance
                for making tough choices.” Mr Mattis also called on Democrats to agree new funding
                ahead of a midnight Friday deadline, warning that the military would suffer if they
                blocked budget proposals. Appealing to Congress, he said: &quot;No strategy can
                survive without predictable funding. As hard as the last 16 years have been, no
                enemy has harmed the US military more than defence spending caps and sequestration.&quot;
                Mr Trump cancelled his trip to Florida on Friday in an attempt to help avoid a
                government shutdown as Republicans piled pressure on their political opponents. The
                US president was due to fly to his Mar-a-Lago resort but stayed in Washington as
                scrambled negotiations played out behind the scenes. A fierce blame game erupted in
                the American capital as political rivals pointed the finger at each other over who
                was at fault. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, accused
                Democrats of being unpatriotic by threatening to block a funding extension. “The
                American people, the citizens who actually elected us, will be watching,&quot; he
                said. &quot;They will see which senators make the patriotic decision, stand up for
                the American people and vote to continue government funding.&quot; Chuck Schumer,
                the most senior Democrat in the Senate, noted that Mr Trump once said that America
                could use “a good shutdown”.

                The traditional three-legged retirement stool -- consisting of pensions, personal
                savings and Social Security benefits -- is looking wobblier than ever. Defined
                benefit pension plans, which have been disappearing for some time, are now on the
                verge of extinction. Just 8 percent of private employers offered pension plans in
                2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

                Jeffrey Milstein’s overhead images of ports, train yards, airports, parking lots,
                and cityscapes, reveal harmonious symmetries invisible during daily life yet still

                Jeffrey Milstein’s overhead images of ports, train yards, airports, parking lots,
                and cityscapes, reveal harmonious symmetries invisible during daily life yet still

                Thai police have arrested an alleged kingpin in Asia's illegal trade in endangered

                Vietnamese national with Thai citizenship, was arrested on Friday evening over the
                smuggling of 14 rhino horns worth around $1 million from Africa to Thailand.

                SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Top financial officials in Puerto Rico offered a peek
                Friday into why the U.S. territory is mired in an 11-year recession as a federal
                control board demanded more transparency and information about the island&#39;s
                finances.

                Congress failed to pass a spending bill by Friday at midnight, triggering a shutdown
                of the federal government. The move has big repercussions for America. US troops
                will continue their duties, and post will get delivered, but almost half of the two
                million civilian federal workers would be barred from doing their jobs. Here&apos;s
                a look at what it means to shut down the government. Intelligence work will be
                scaled down The workforce at the 17 US intelligence agencies will be pared down
                significantly. An official said employees who are considered essential and have to
                work will do so with no expectation of a regular pay cheque. While they can be
                ordered to stay on the job, federal workers can&apos;t be paid for days worked
                during a shutdown. In the past, however, they have been paid retroactively even if
                they were told to stay at home. National Parks and museums The Smithsonian museums
                in Washington, and the National Zoo, which are huge tourist attractions, will close
                from Monday if the shutdown continues. First Lady Melania Trump at the Smithsonian
                National Museum of American History Credit: AFP Staff will continue to feed animals
                at the zoo but the well-known Panda Cam will cease broadcasting. The Interior
                Department said that in the event of a government shutdown, national parks and other
                public lands will remain as &quot;accessible as possible&quot;. That position is a
                change from previous shutdowns when most parks were closed and became high-profile
                symbols of dysfunction. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman, said the American public -
                especially veterans who come to the nation&apos;s capital - should find war
                memorials and open-air parks available to visitors. Ms Swift said many national
                parks and wildlife refuges nationwide will also be open with limited access when
                possible. She said public roads that were already open are likely to remain open,
                although services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds,
                full-service restrooms and concessions won&apos;t be operating. Backcountry lands
                and culturally sensitive sites are likely to be restricted or closed, she said.
                Panda Cam would stop broadcasting Credit: Reuters Health research disrupted Dr
                Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, said a
                government shutdown will disrupt research and morale but will not adversely affect
                patients already in medical studies. &quot;We still take care of them,&quot; he said
                of current NIH patients. But other types of research would be seriously harmed. A
                shutdown could mean interrupting research that&apos;s been going on for years, he
                said. The NIH is the government&apos;s primary agency responsible for biomedical and
                public health research, ranging from cancer studies to the testing and creation of
                vaccines. &quot;You can&apos;t push the pause button on an experiment,&quot; he
                said. Law enforcement training to be cancelled Many of the nearly 115,000 US Justice
                Department employees have national security and public safety responsibilities that
                allow them to keep working during a shutdown. So will special counsel Robert Mueller&apos;s
                team investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election. His
                office is paid for indefinitely. Criminal cases will continue, but civil lawsuits
                will be postponed as long as doing so doesn&apos;t compromise public safety. Most
                law enforcement training will be cancelled, according to the department&apos;s
                contingency plan. Visas could be disrupted Grounded? Rex Tillerson Credit: Reuters
                Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman. said security for American diplomats
                overseas wouldn&apos;t be affected. But no decision had yet been made about what
                services, such as visa processing and passports, the State Department would be able
                to provide. Nor had there been a decision about whether Rex Tillerson, the Secretary
                of State, could go ahead with a planned trip to Europe next week if the government
                closed.

                million civilian federal workers would be barred from doing their jobs. Here&apos;s
                a look at what it means to shut down the government. Intelligence work will be
                scaled down The workforce at the 17 US intelligence agencies will be pared down
                significantly. An official said employees who are considered essential and have to
                work will do so with no expectation of a regular pay cheque. While they can be
                ordered to stay on the job, federal workers can&apos;t be paid for days worked
                during a shutdown. In the past, however, they have been paid retroactively even if
                they were told to stay at home. National Parks and museums The Smithsonian museums
                in Washington, and the National Zoo, which are huge tourist attractions, will close
                from Monday if the shutdown continues. First Lady Melania Trump at the Smithsonian
                National Museum of American History Credit: AFP Staff will continue to feed animals
                at the zoo but the well-known Panda Cam will cease broadcasting. The Interior
                Department said that in the event of a government shutdown, national parks and other
                public lands will remain as &quot;accessible as possible&quot;. That position is a
                change from previous shutdowns when most parks were closed and became high-profile
                symbols of dysfunction. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman, said the American public -
                especially veterans who come to the nation&apos;s capital - should find war
                memorials and open-air parks available to visitors. Ms Swift said many national
                parks and wildlife refuges nationwide will also be open with limited access when
                possible. She said public roads that were already open are likely to remain open,
                although services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds,
                full-service restrooms and concessions won&apos;t be operating. Backcountry lands
                and culturally sensitive sites are likely to be restricted or closed, she said.
                Panda Cam would stop broadcasting Credit: Reuters Health research disrupted Dr
                Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, said a
                government shutdown will disrupt research and morale but will not adversely affect
                patients already in medical studies. &quot;We still take care of them,&quot; he said
                of current NIH patients. But other types of research would be seriously harmed. A
                shutdown could mean interrupting research that&apos;s been going on for years, he
                said. The NIH is the government&apos;s primary agency responsible for biomedical and
                public health research, ranging from cancer studies to the testing and creation of
                vaccines. &quot;You can&apos;t push the pause button on an experiment,&quot; he
                said. Law enforcement training to be cancelled Many of the nearly 115,000 US Justice
                Department employees have national security and public safety responsibilities that
                allow them to keep working during a shutdown. So will special counsel Robert Mueller&apos;s
                team investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election. His
                office is paid for indefinitely. Criminal cases will continue, but civil lawsuits
                will be postponed as long as doing so doesn&apos;t compromise public safety. Most
                law enforcement training will be cancelled, according to the department&apos;s
                contingency plan. Visas could be disrupted Grounded? Rex Tillerson Credit: Reuters
                Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman. said security for American diplomats
                overseas wouldn&apos;t be affected. But no decision had yet been made about what
                services, such as visa processing and passports, the State Department would be able
                to provide. Nor had there been a decision about whether Rex Tillerson, the Secretary
                of State, could go ahead with a planned trip to Europe next week if the government
                closed.

                The boys, aged 12 and 13, have been charged with knocking over 50 beehives at the
                Wild Hill Honey farm in Sioux City which caused half a million bees to freeze to
                death in late December. Wild Hill Honey owner Justin Engelhardt claimed the boys had
                caused $60,000 (£42,000) of damage in what he called a “completely senseless” act.
                Mr Engelhardt said he and his wife had discovered the destruction on 28 December
                when they went to dust snow off the hives.

                The boys, aged 12 and 13, have been charged with knocking over 50 beehives at the
                Wild Hill Honey farm in Sioux City which caused half a million bees to freeze to
                death in late December. Wild Hill Honey owner Justin Engelhardt claimed the boys had
                caused $60,000 (£42,000) of damage in what he called a “completely senseless” act.
                Mr Engelhardt said he and his wife had discovered the destruction on 28 December
                when they went to dust snow off the hives.

                By Jeanny Kao and Brenda Goh TAIPEI/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Taiwan's aviation regulator
                has stalled applications for new flights from China Eastern Airlines and Xiamen
                Airlines amid a row between Beijing and the self-ruled island over air routes, a
                regulatory official said on Friday. Taiwan had not yet approved the applications to
                add flights during the approaching Lunar New Year holiday because in recent weeks
                the airlines had used four disputed air routes close to the island, said the
                official, who asked not to be identified. This month China opened several disputed
                air routes, including a northbound M503 route in the Taiwan Strait, without
                informing Taiwan, contravening what the democratic government in Taipei said was a
                2015 deal to first discuss such flight paths.

                Mexico is on the verge of being a failed state, swept by violence from powerful drug
                cartels who have turned the nation's cities and villages into bloody battlegrounds.
                Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department approved a $98.4 million weapons sale
                to Mexico, including RGM-84L Harpoon Block II anti-ship missiles, Rolling Airframe
                Missile (RAM) systems designed to shoot down antiship missiles and Mark 54
                antisubmarine torpedoes. The high-tech weaponry is intended for the Mexican Navy's
                new Sigma 10514–class long-range patrol ships.

                Mexico is on the verge of being a failed state, swept by violence from powerful drug
                cartels who have turned the nation's cities and villages into bloody battlegrounds.
                Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department approved a $98.4 million weapons sale
