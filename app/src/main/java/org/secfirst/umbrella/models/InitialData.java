This means that only those people who really need that piece of information to operate should be given it. For example, if a team is working with a high-risk source, only the source’s direct contact within the team should have his or her real name and details – the rest of the team can operate using a code name. This reduces the risk for both the source and those other members of the team.</p><img src=\"managing_information1.png\"><p>If there is not a good reason to keep a piece of sensitive information then you should simply delete it (see the <a href=\"umbrella://lesson/safely-deleting\">Safely Deleting lesson</a>).</p>"));

Managing your information securely isn’t about which tools you use; it’s about understanding the threats you face and how you can counter those threats. To become more secure, you should figure out what you need to protect, and whom you need to protect it from. Threats can change depending on where you’re located, what you’re doing, and whom you’re working with.

What do you want to protect?</h2><p>What information could put you, your work or others at risk if were public? This is often the kind of information kept in your emails, contact lists, messages and files. It might relate to a specific sensitive campaign you are working on.</p><h2>2. Who do you want to protect it from?</h2><p>This could be any person or entity that poses a threat against an your or your work, also known as an adversary. Think about who would have a motive in reading or deleting your information or disrupting your work. Examples could be a government, a company you are exposing, your boss, or a hacker.</p><h2>3. How likely is it that you will need to protect it?</h2><p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. Calculating risk means figuring out the chance that a threat might actually occur – how likely is it that a threat would be carried out? You also need to think about the capability of potential attackers. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all of your phone records and therefore has the capability to use or share that data. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. A government might have stronger capabilities.</p><h2>4. How bad are the consequences if you fail?</h2><p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A company trying to prevent the spread of a video showing their illegal activity may simply want to delete the video, whereas a government may wish to gain access to the names/details of activists it sees as a threat to the state in order to arrest or harass them.</p><h2>5. How much trouble are you willing to go through in order to try to prevent those?</h2><p>This means figuring out which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.</p>" ));

Password managers like this are more convenient, but the trade-off is that they are more vulnerable to attack.

People who are trying to avoid surveillance sometimes try to change phones and numbers frequently to make it more difficult to recognise their communications.

There are many ways this can be done. For example, an analyst could check whether two devices tended to move together, or whether, even if they were in use at different times, they tended to be carried in the same physical locations.</li><li>A third problem for the successful anonymous use of telephone services is that people's calling patterns tend to be extremely distinctive. For example, you might habitually call your family members and your work colleagues. Even though each of these people receives calls from a wide range of people, you're likely the only person in the world who commonly calls both of them from the same number. So even if you suddenly changed your number, if you then resumed the same patterns in the calls you made or received, it would be straightforward to determine which new number was yours. Remember that this inference isn't made based only on the fact that you called one particular number, but rather on the uniqueness of the combination of all the numbers that you called.</li></ul></p><p>Together, these facts mean that effective use of burner phones to hide from government surveillance requires, at a minimum:<ul><li>Not reusing either SIM cards or devices;</li><li>Not carrying different devices together;</li><li>Not creating a physical association between the places where different devices are used;</li><li>And not calling or being called by the same people when using different devices.</li><li>(This isn’t necessarily a complete list; for example, we haven’t considered the risk of physical surveillance of the place where the phone was sold, or the places where it's used, or the possibility of software to recognize a particular person's voice as an automated method for determining who is speaking through a particular phone.)</li></ul></p>"));

Elevating the VHF antenna may improve the radio’s transmission range. Also, installing a repeater, which automatically receives and re-transmits radio signals, can further extend the range.

(For example, people in locations where they shouldn’t be or aren’t normally).</li><li><b>Filter out coincidence</b><br>Filter out the chances that something could be a coincidence by concentrating on unusual activities and applying common sense filters (e.g. if someone is standing in a place where people don’t normally stand pay more attention to them. Do they look like they are from the area? Are they paying an unusual amount of attention to your activities?) Look for 3 signs that something is out of the ordinary or 3 repeat sightings.</li><li><b>Notify others</b><br>It is important to notify others of any suspicions and to keep a log of them.

For example, if you notice someone suspicious and then a colleague notices something else suspicious on a separate occasion but this information is not shared, then a valuable opportunity to confirm a security threat is missed.</li><li><b>Trust your senses</b><br>Trust your senses – there may be clues of a potential arrest or violent attack.

Be very wary of conducting sensitive activities in fixed locations (such as the office of a partner or a hotel room) for too long or repetitively. Limiting the provision of information in advance (for example, of which rooms will be used for conferences in specific hotels) is also useful as it reduces the time a hostile organisation has to plant a device. Outside in the open air can also be a good place to discuss sensitive matters. Make sure you are not overlooked.</p>If dealing with sensitive matters, always assume the room is bugged.

Your phone contains a wealth of private data, which can include your list of contacts, the people you have recently called, your text messages and email, photos and video, GPS location data, your web browsing history and passwords, and the contents of your social media accounts. Through stored passwords or active logins, access to the device can allow someone to obtain yet even more information on remote servers.

If you take your mobile phone with you to a protest, it makes it easy for the government to figure out that you are there.

While password-protecting your phone is a small barrier to access, please be aware that it is not an effective barrier to expert forensic analysis.</li><li><b>Encryption:</b>Some phones have encryption options available – these should be applied. If you have an Android phone this can be done in Settings -> Personal -> Security -> Encryption. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a guide on how to encrypt iPhones.</li><li><b>Download secure apps:</b> Make sure you and your colleagues have downloaded apps that will allow you to communicate and operate securely.

You may wish to encrypt your messages using Textsecure (Androids) or Signal (iPhones), or encrypt your phone calls using RedPhone (Androids) or, again, Signal (iPhones). All these apps are compatible. You can read more about them in the Sending a Message or Making a Call lessons.</p><p>Please remember that even if your communications are encrypted, your metadata is not; this means your mobile phone will still give away your location and information such as whom you are talking to and for how long.</p><p>When capturing pictures or video it is important to be careful of privacy and safety of those pictured. For example, if you take photos or record video of a sensitive event, it might be dangerous to you or to those who appear in the recordings if your phone fell into the wrong hands. The Guardian Project has created an app called ObscuraCam to detect/select faces on photos and blur them. It also deletes the original photos and if you have set up a server to upload the captured media, it provides an easy way to upload it.</p><p>Metadata such as phone identity and location are also captured on photos and videos. In some instances, such information is really important to have to prove the credibility of images and video so that they could be used as evidence in courts of law. At other times metadata can put you or others at risk.

Messenger, Facebook chat, Windows Live Messenger, AIM, ICQ, and XMPP.</p><p>OTR  (Off-the-record) is a protocol that allows people to have confidential conversations using the messaging tools they’re already familiar with. This should not be confused with Google's “Off the record,” which merely disables chat logging, and does not have encryption or verification capabilities. For Mac users, OTR comes built-in with the Adium client.</p><p>OTR employs end-to-end encryption. This means that you can use it to have conversations over services like Google Hangouts or Facebook without those companies ever having access to the contents of the conversations. This is different from the way in which Google and AOL use the term “off the record” to mean that a conversation is not being logged; that option does not encrypt your conversation.</p><h3>Why should I use Adium + OTR?</h3><p>When you have a chat conversation using Google Hangouts or Facebook chat on the Google or Facebook websites, that chat is encrypted using HTTPS , which means the content of your chat is protected from hackers and other third parties while it’s in transit. It is not, however, protected from Google or Facebook, which have the keys to your conversations and can hand them over to authorities.</p><p>After you have installed Adium, you can sign in to it using multiple accounts at the same time. For example, you could use Google Hangouts, Facebook, and XMPP simultaneously. Adium also allows you to chat using these tools without OTR. Since OTR only works if both people are using it, this means that even if the other person does not have it installed, you can still chat with them using Adium.</p><p>Adium also allows you to do out-of-band verification to make sure that you’re talking to the person you think you’re talking to and you are not being subject to a MITM attack. For every conversation, there is an option that will show you the key fingerprints it has for you and the person with whom you are chatting. A \"key fingerprint\" is a string of characters like \"342e 2309 bd20 0912 ff10 6c63 2192 1928,” that’s used to verify a longer public key. Exchange your fingerprints through another communications channel, such as Twitter DM or email, to make sure that no one is interfering with your conversation.</p><h3>Limitations: When should I not use Adium + OTR?</h3><p>Technologists have a term to describe when a program or technology might be vulnerable to external attack: they say it has a large “attack surface.” Adium has a large attack surface. It is a complex program, which has not been written with security as a top priority. It almost certainly has bugs, some of which might be used by governments or even big companies to break into computers that are using it. Using Adium to encrypt your conversations is a great defense against the kind of untargeted dragnet surveillance that is used to spy on everyone's Internet conversations, but if you think you will be personally targeted by a well-resourced attacker (like a nation-state), you should consider stronger precautions, such as PGP -encrypted email.</p><h3>Installing Adium + OTR On Your Mac</h3><p>Step 1: Install the program</p><p>First, go to <a href=\"https://adium.im/\">https://adium.im/</a> in your browser. Choose “Download Adium 1.5.9.” The file will download as a .dmg, or disk image, and will probably be saved to your “downloads” folder.</p><p>Double-click on the file; that will open up a window that looks like this:</p><img src=\"tool_adium1.png\"><p>Move the Adium icon into the “Applications” folder to install the program. Once the program is installed, look for it in your Applications folder and double-click to open it.</p><p>Step 2: Set up your account(s)</p><p>First, you will need to decide what chat tools or protocols you want to use with Adium. The setup process is similar, but not identical, for each type of tool. You will need to know your account name for each tool or protocol, as well as your password for each account.</p><p>To set up an account, go to the Adium menu at the top of your screen and click “Adium” and then “Preferences.” This will open a window with another menu at the top. Select “Accounts,” then click the “+” sign at the bottom of the window. You will see a menu that looks like this:</p><img src=\"tool_adium2.png\"><p>Select the program that you wish to sign in to. From here, you will be prompted either to enter your username and password, or to use Adium’s authorization tool to sign in to your account. Follow Adium’s instructions carefully.</p><h3>How to Initiate an OTR Chat</h3><p>Once you have signed in to one or more of your accounts, you can start using OTR.</p><p><b>Remember: In order to have a conversation using OTR, both people need to be using a chat program that supports OTR.</b></p><p>Step 1: Initiate an OTR chat</p><p>First, identify someone who is using OTR, and initiate a conversation with them in Adium by double-clicking on their name. Once you have opened the chat window, you will see a small, open lock in the upper left-hand corner of the chat window. Click on the lock and select “Initiate Encrypted OTR Chat.”</p><p>Step 2: Verify your connection</p><p>Once you have initiated the chat and the other person has accepted the invitation, you will see the lock icon close; this is how you know that your chat is now encrypted (congratulations!) – But wait, there’s still another step!</p><p>At this time, you have initiated an unverified, encrypted chat. This means that while your communications are encrypted, you have not yet determined and verified the identity of the person you are chatting with. Unless you are in the same room and can see each other’s screens, it is important that you verify each other’s identities. (For more information, read the EFF module on <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/key-verification#overlay=en/node/37/\">Key Verification</a>.)</p><p>To verify another user’s identity using Adium, click again on the lock, and select “Verify.” You will be shown a window that displays both your key and the key of the other user. Some versions of Adium only support manual fingerprint verification. This means that, using some method, you and the person with whom you’re chatting will need to check to make sure that the keys that you are being shown by Adium match precisely.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to read them aloud to one another in person, but that’s not always possible. There are different ways to accomplish this with varying degrees of trustworthiness. For example, you can read your keys aloud to one another on the phone if you recognize each other’s voices or send them using another verified method of communication such as PGP. Some people publicise their key on their website, Twitter account, or business card.</p><p><b>The most important thing is that you verify that every single letter and digit matches perfectly.</b></p><p>Now that you have initiated an encrypted chat and verified your chat partner’s identity, there’s one more thing you need to do. Unfortunately, Adium logs your OTR-encrypted chats by default, saving them to your hard drive. This means that, despite the fact that they’re encrypted, they are being saved in plain text on your hard drive.</p><p>To disable logging, click “Adium” in the menu at the top of your screen, then “Preferences.” In the new window, select “General” and then disable “Log messages” and “Log OTR-secured chats.” Your settings should now look like this:</p><img src=\"tool_adium3.png\"><p>Also, when Adium displays notifications of new messages, the contents of those messages may be logged by the OS X Notification Center. This means that while Adium leaves no trace of your communications on your own computer or your correspondent's, either your or their computer's version of OS X may preserve a record. To prevent this, you may want to disable notifications.</p><p>To do this, select \"Events\" in the Preferences window, and look for any entries that say \"Display a notification.\" For each entry, expand it by clicking the gray triangle, and then click the newly-exposed line that say \"Display a notification,\" then click the minus icon (\"-\") at the lower left to remove that line.\" If you are worried about records left on your computer, you should also turn on full-disk encryption, which will help protect this data from being obtained by a third party without your password.</p><img src=\"tool_adium4.png\">"));

ChatSecure allows users to send instant messages and chats using a cell phone, instead of with a traditional desktop or laptop computer. It's compatible with iPhone and Android phones.</p><p>ChatSecure supports OTR  encryption  over XMPP. All messages sent via ChatSecure are completely private, so long as the person you are chatting with is also using an OTR compatible instant messaging client like ChatSecure, Adium, Pidgin, or Jitsi. The app’s capabilities allow it to deliver audio messages, photos, files, or text.</p><p>When you send messages using ChatSecure, they are not stored on the phone system's memory. ChatSecure used with the privacy plugin Orbot should be able to bypass most firewalls, network restrictions, and blacklists. The app can manage multiple accounts, so you can chat with your Facebook friends, Google contacts, or other privacy conscious users that use an instant messaging program that supports OTR encryption.</p><h3>How to install and configure ChatSecure</h3><p>1. Download and install ChatSecure</p><p>Visit the Apple App Store or Google Play store and search for ChatSecure by The Guardian Project. Select “Install” and accept the Terms of Service by clicking “Accept.” The app will download and install automatically.</p><p>2. Open the app and set your password</p><p>When you open the app you will be promoted to set a password. You will be prompted to create a passphrase  in order to locally encrypt your data. If you choose to do this, your data will be encrypted in transit, as well as encrypted locally on your phone.<br>If you choose to skip this step, your messages will still be encrypted in transit, but will not be protected on your device. For more information on selecting a strong passphrase, see the <a href=\"umbrella://lesson/passwords\">Passwords lesson</a>.</p><p>3. Configure your accounts</p><p>You can add a variety of different accounts your ChatSecure app. To add GoogleTalk or Google Hangouts, choose “Google.” To add any XMPP or Jabber messaging service, choose “Jabber (XMPP).” To add your Facebook account, also choose “Jabber (XMPP).”<br>Once you’ve added your account, type in your username (or email address) and your password to sign in. Your contacts should load automatically.</p><p>To add a second or third account, click on the “accounts” tab in the menu. In the upper right hand corner, click on the “+” sign. You can either choose to add an existing account or create a new account.</p><h3>How to use ChatSecure</h3><p>1. Sign in to your accounts</p><p>To sign in to your account, click on the “accounts” tab in the menu and turn on the accounts you wish to use. Once you sign in, anyone can connect with you from a mobile or desktop instant messaging application.</p><p>2. Start end-to-end encryption</p><p>Once you’ve started a chat with someone, click on the unlocked lock icon on the top menu bar of the display. Choose “Start Encryption.” If the person you are chatting with has an OTR compatible instant messaging system, then you will have the option to verify your (and their) fingerprint.</p><p>ChatSecure offers three ways to verify OTR fingerprints, but if you're chatting with someone over a desktop instant messenger and not with ChatSecure, the best way to verify an OTR fingerprint is by communicating through another channel. You can resend your fingerprint over an SMS (TextSecure), say it over the phone if you recognize one another's voices, use PGP email, or verify in person. Click on “manual verification” and ChatSecure will display your and your friend's fingerprints. If you can confirm that you both have the same information, you can click “verify.”</p><p>ChatSecure supports manual verification or verification by scanning the other user’s barcode (QR). If you are in the same room as the other person, you can easily scan the barcode on their phone or read your keys aloud to one another.</p><p>3. Understand your options</p><p>• Just like a desktop instant messaging service, ChatSecure gives you the option to appear offline, busy, idle, or away. To change this setting click on your name at the top of your friends list.<br>• ChatSecure also allows you to initiate group chats and add new contacts, both of which can be done from the main menu. (Note that group chats cannot be secured like one-on-one chats due to limitations of the OTR protocol.)<br>• The app supports multimedia messaging, can take pictures, and can send photos and files securely if your friend is also using end-to-end encryption and you are able to verify her identity.<br>• ChatSecure gives you the option to create a new XMPP or Jabber messaging account that supports OTR encryption. If you don't already use XMPP messaging, this is a great opportunity to create one and experiment with non-proprietary messaging.</p>"));

Things you should know about this tool before you start</h3><p>Cobian Backup is used to archive, (or to make a backup copy) of your files and directories. Backups can be stored in other directories or drives on your computer, other computers on the office network, or on removable devices (CDs, DVDs and USB memory sticks). Cobian Backup lets you archive your directories and files on a regular basis. It works silently in the background on your system (that is, in the system tray), checking your schedule and executing the backup process when necessary. Cobian Backup can also compress and encrypt files as it generates the backup file.</p><p>• Using Cobian will give you:<br>• The ability to back up all documents, files and folders<br>• The ability to compress and decompress your backup files<br>• The ability to encrypt and decrypt your archived files</p><p><b>Installing Cobian – in brief</b><br>• Open www.cobiansoft.com/cobianbackup.htm<br>• Click on the link \"Download Cobian Backup\" on the page.<br>• Save the installer, then find it and doubleclick it<br>• Read the 'Installation Note' below before you continue<br>• After you have successfully installed Cobian you may delete the installation program from your computer.</p><h3>2.0 How to Install Cobian Backup</h3><p><b>Installation Note:</b> Before you begin the installation process, verify that you have both the latest versions of the <b>Microsoft Windows Installer</b> and the <b>Microsoft.NET Framework</b>.</p><p>Installing Cobian Backup is a relatively easy and quick procedure. </p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Double click “cbsetup.exe”; the <i>Open File - Security Warning</i> dialog box may appear. If it does, click “Run” to activate the light blue <i>Extracting the resource</i> progress status bar, followed a few moments later by the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian1.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Next” to activate the <i>Please read and accept the license agreement screen</i> check the <i>I accept</i> option, and then click “Next” again to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian2.png\"><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian3.png\"><p><b>Step 4.</b> Check the <i>Use Local System account</i> option in the <i>Service options</i> pane, so that your own resembles Figure 3 above. This option ensures that Cobian Backup will be running silently in the background all the time, so that your backups will occur as scheduled.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Next” to activate the following message prompt:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian4.png\"><p><b>Step 6.</b> Click “Yes” to activate the next installation screen, and then click “Next” to continue with the installation process.</p><p><b>Step 7.</b> Click “Done” to complete the installation process. After the installation process has been completed, the Cobian Backup icon will appear in the <b>Windows System Tray</b>.</p><h3>2.1 How to Backup Your Directories and Files</h3><p>In this section you will learn how to perform a simple backup or archive of a specified files and/or folders. Cobian Backup uses a <i>backup task</i> which can be configured to include a specified group of files and/or folders. A backup task can be set to run on a specified day and time.</p><p>To create a new backup task, perform the following step:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click “Schedule” to create a new backup task, and activate the <i>New task</i> window as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian5.png\"><p>The left sidebar lists a number of tabs and their associated screens - used to set different backup options and parameters - are displayed in the pane at right. All the options in the <i>General</i> tab are described below:</p><h3>2.1.1 Option Descriptions</h3><p><i>Task Name:</i> This <i>Task Name</i> text field lets you enter a name for the backup task. Use a name that identifies the nature of the backup. For example, if the backup is going to contain video files, you could name it <i>Video Backup</i>.</p><p><i>Disabled:</i> This option <i>must</i> be left unchecked.<br>Warning: Enabling the <i>Disabled</i> option will override the rest of the options, and prevent the backup task from running.</p><p><i>Include Subdirectories:</i> This option lets you include all the subdirectories/folders within a selected directory/folder for the backup task. This is an efficient method for backing up a large number of folders and/or files. As an example, if you select the <i>My Documents</i> folder and check this option, then all files and folders in <i>My Documents</i> will be included in the backup task.</p><p><i>Create separated backups using timestamps:</i> This option lets you specify that the date and time of the backup task will be automatically included in the folder name containing your backup file. This is a good idea because it means that you will easily be able to identify when the backup was performed.<br><i>Use file attribute logic:</i> This option is only relevant when you choose to perform an incremental or differential backup (see below). File attributes contain information about the file.</p><p><b>Note:</b> The following option is only available for Windows OS versions more recent than <i>and</i> including Windows XP.</p><p><i>Use Volume Shadow Copy:</i> This option lets you backup files which are locked.<br>Cobian Backup verifies this information to determine whether there has been a change in the source file from the last time a backup was performed. If you then run an <i>Differential</i> or <i>Incremental</i> backup, the file will be updated.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You will only be able to run a full or 'dummy backup' if you <i>disable this option</i> (the dummy backup option is explained below).</p><h3>2.1.2 Backup type Descriptions</h3><p><i>Full:</i> This option means that every single file in the source location will be copied to your backup directory. If you have enabled the <i>Create separated backups using timestamp</i> option, you will have several copies of the same source (identified by the time and date of the backup in the folder title). Otherwise, Cobian Backup will overwrite the previous version (if any).</p><p><i>Incremental:</i> This option means the program will verify if the files selected for backup have been changed since the last backup was performed. If there has been no change, it will be skipped over during the backup process, saving backup time. The <i>Use file attribute logic</i> option needs to be checked in order to perform this backup.</p><p><i>Differential:</i> The program will check if the source has been changed from the last <b>full</b> backup. If there is no need to copy that file, it will be skipped, saving backup time. If you have run a full backup before on the same set of files, then you can continue backing it up, using the Differential method.</p><p><i>Dummy task:</i> You can use this option to get your computer to run or shut down programs at certain times. This is a more advanced option which is not really relevant to our basic backup procedure.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “OK” to confirm your search options and parameters for your backup task.</p><h3>2.2 How to Create a Backup File</h3><p>To begin creating a backup file, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click “Files” in the left sidebar of the <i>New task</i> window to display a <i>blank</i> version of the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian6.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select the files you want to back up. (In <i>Figure 3</i> above, the <i>My Documents</i> folder is selected.)</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Add” in the <i>Source</i> pane to activate the <i>Directory</i> menu.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Select <i>Directory</i> if you want to back up an entire directory, and <i>Files</i> to back up individual files. To specify individual files or directories to be backed up, select <i>Manually</i>, and type in the file path or directory for your backup.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You can add as many files or directories as you like. If you wish to back up files currently on your FTP server, choose the FTP site option (you will need to have the appropriate server login details).</p><p>When you have selected the files and/or folders, they will appear in the <i>Source</i> area. As you can see in <i>Figure 3</i> above, the <i>My Documents</i> folder is displayed there, meaning this folder will now be included in the backup task.</p><p>The <i>Destination</i> pane specifies where the backup will be stored.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Add” in the <i>Destination</i> pane to activate the Directory menu.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Select <i>Directory</i> to open a browser window where you select the destination folder for your backup file.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you want to create several versions of the backup file, you may specify several folders here. If you selected the <i>Manually</i> option, you must type in the full path to the folder where you want to keep the backup. To use a remote Internet server to store your archive, select the FTP site option (you will need to have the appropriate server login details).</p><p>The screen should now resemble the example above example with file(s) and/or folder(s) in the source area and folder(s) in the destination area. However, don't click <i>OK</i> just yet! You still need to set a schedule for your backup.</p><h3>2.3 How to Schedule Your Backup Task</h3><p>For your automatic backup to work, you need to fill in the <i>Schedule</i> section. This section lets you specify when you want the backup to be performed.<br>To set the schedule options, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select “Schedule” from the left sidebar, to activate the following pane:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian7.png\"><p>The <i>Schedule type</i> options are listed in the drop-down menu, and described below:</p><p><i>Once:</i> The backup will be done once only at the date and time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Daily:</i> The backup will be done every day at the time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Weekly:</i> The backup will be done on the days of the week selected. In the example above, the backup will be done on Fridays. You may select other days also. The backup will be done on all days selected at the time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Monthly:</i> The backup will be done on the days typed into the days of the month box at the time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Yearly:</i> The backup will be done on the days typed into the days of the month box, during the month specified, and at the time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Timer:</i> The backup will be done repeatedly at intervals specified in the Timer text box in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Manually:</i> You will have to run the backup yourself from the main program window.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “OK” to confirm the options and settings for the backup schedule as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian8.png\"><p>Once you have decided on a backup schedule, you have completed the final step. The backup will now run on the folders specified according to the schedule you have chosen.</p><h3>3.0 How to Compress Your Backup File</h3><p><b>Step 1.</b> Create a backup task as documented in section 2.3, containing the backup files you want to archive.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select “Archive” from the left sidebar to activate the <i>New task</i> screen as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian9.png\"><p>The <b>Compression</b> pane is used to specify the method for compressing your backup.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Compression is used to reduce the amount of space for file storage. If you have a bunch of old files that you use only occasionally, but you still want to keep, it would make sense to store them in a format where they take up as little space as possible. Compression works by removing a lot of unnecessary coding out of your documents, while leaving important information intact. Compression does not damage your original data. The files are not viewable when compressed. The process must be reversed and your files 'decompressed' when you want to view the files again.</p><p>The three sub-options in the <i>Compression type</i> drop-down list are:</p><p><i>No Compression:</i> This option does not perform any compression, as you would expect.</p><p><i>Zip Compression:</i> This option is the standard compression technique for <b>Windows</b> systems, and the most convenient. Archives once created can be opened with standard Windows tools (or you can download the <a href=\"http://www.zipgenius.it/\">ZipGenius</a> program to access them).</p><p>Selecting a compression type listed automatically enables the <i>Split options</i> section, and its corresponding drop-down list.</p><p>The <i>Split options</i> apply to storage on removable media, for example CDs, DVDs, floppy disks and USB memory sticks. The various split options will subdivide the archive into sizes that will fit onto your storage device of choice.</p><p>Example: Let's say that you are archiving a large number of files, and you want to burn them to a CD. However, your archive size turns out to be larger than 700MB (the size of a CD). The splitting function will split the archive into pieces smaller than or equal to 700MB, which you can then burn onto your CDs. If you are planning to back up onto your computer's hard disk, or the files that you want to back up are smaller than the device you plan to store them on, you can skip this section.</p><p>The following options are available to you when you click on the <i>Split options</i> drop-down list. Your choice will depend on the type of removable storage device available to you.</p><img src=\"tool_cobian10.png\"><p>• 3,5\" - Floppy disk. This option is big enough to perform backup of a small number of documents<br>• Zip - Zip Disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a special Zip Drive in your computer and the custom-made disks<br>• CD-R - CD disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a CD Writer in your computer and a CD writing program (see <a href=\"http://www.deepburner.com/\">DeepBurner Free</a> version or other <a href=\"http://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/dvdcdburning.shtml\">disk burning tools</a>).<br>• DVD - DVD disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a DVD Writer in your computer and a DVD writing program (see <a href=\"http://www.deepburner.com/\">DeepBurner Free</a> version or other <a href=\"http://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/dvdcdburning.shtml\">disk burning tools</a>).</p><p>If you are backing up onto several USB memory sticks you may want to set a custom size.</p><p>To do this, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1. Select</b> the <i>Custom size</i> (bytes) option, then type the size of the archive in bytes into the text field.</p><p>To give you an idea of sizes<br>• 1KB (kilobyte) = 1024 bytes - a one-page text document made in Open Office is approximately 20kb<br>• 1MB (megabyte) = 1024 KB - a photo taken on a digital camera is usually between 1 - 3 MB<br>• 1GB (gigabyte) = 1024 MB - approximately half hour of a DVD quality movie</p><p><b>Note:</b> When choosing a custom size to split your backup for a CD or DVD disk, Cobian Backup will not copy the backup to your removable device automatically. Rather, it will create your archive in those files on the computer and you will need to burn them to the CD or DVD disk yourself.</p><p><i>Password Protect:</i> This option lets you enter a password to protect the archive. Simply type, then re-type a password into the two boxes provided. When you try to decompress the archive, you will be asked for the password before the task commences.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you want to secure your archive, you should think about using another method than a password. Cobian Backup lets you encrypt your archive. This is covered below.</p><p><i>Comment:</i> This option lets you write something descriptive about the archive, but it is not a requirement.</p><h3>3.1 How to Decompress Your Backup File</h3><p>To decompress your backup, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1. Select > Tools > Decompressor.</b></p><p>The Decompressor window appears as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian11.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click on the open file icon to open a browse window to enable you to select the archive you want to decompress.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Select the archive (<i>.zip</i> or <i>.7x</i> file) and then click “OK”.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Select a directory into which you will unpack (output) the archived file.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click on the compression icon to open another window that lets you choose the folder in which to unpack the archive.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Select a folder, and then click “OK”.</p><p>Use Windows Explorer to view the files that go to that folder.</p><h3>4.0 About Encryption</h3><p>Encryption may be a necessity for those wishing to keep their backup secure from unauthorised access. Encryption is the process of encoding, or scrambling, data in such a way that it appears unintelligible to anyone who does not have the specific key needed to decode the message. For more information on encryption, read the <a href=\"umbrella://lesson/protecting-files\">Protecting Files lesson</a>.</p> <h3>4.1 How to Encrypt Your Backup File</h3><p>The <i>Strong encryption</i> pane is used to specify the encryption method to be used.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click the <i>Encryption</i> type drop-down box to activate its list of different encryption methods. </p><p>To keep things simple, we recommend that you choose from either the <i>Blowfish</i> or the <i>Rijndael</i> (128 bits) methods. These will provide excellent security for your archive, and let you access the encrypted data with a chosen password.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select the <i>Encryption</i> type you want to use.</p><p><b>Note:</b> <i>Rijndael</i> and <i>Blowfish</i> both offer approximately the same level of security. <i>DES</i> is weaker but the encryption process is faster.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Type and re-type the password into the two boxes provided.</p><p>The strength of the password is indicated by the bar marked 'Passphrase quality'. The further the bar moves to the right, the stronger the passphrase. Refer to the <b><a href=\"umbrella://lesson/passwords\">Passwords lesson</a></b> for information on creating and storing strong passwords.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Click “OK”.</p><h3>4.2 How to Decrypt Your Backup File</h3><p>Decrypting your backup file is easy and quick. To decrypt your backup file, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1. Select > Tools > Decrypter and Keys:</b></p><p><i>This will activate the Decrypter and Keys window as follows:</i></p><img src=\"tool_cobian12.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Select” to select the archive you want to decrypt.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Destination” to select the folder in which to store the decrypted archive.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Select the same encryption type you selected earlier, in section 4.1 How to Encrypt Your Backup File, in the <i>Methods</i> drop-down list.</p><p><b>Step 4. Select</b> the appropriate encryption method (the one you used to encrypt your backup file).</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Type your passphrase into the <i>Passphrase</i> text fields.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Click “Decrypt!”</p><p>The file(s) will be decrypted to the location that you specified. If the files were also compressed, you will need to decompress them as outlined in section 3.1 How to Decompress Your Backup.</p>"));

Graph Search allows users to make structured searches to filter through friends, friends of friends, and strangers. This feature relies on your profile information being made widely or publicly available, yet there are some Likes, photos, or other pieces of information that you might not want out there.</p><p>Since Facebook removed the ability to remove yourself from search results altogether, the Electronic Frontier Foundation put together a quick how-to guide to help you take control over what is featured on your Facebook profile and on Graph Search results – we have outlined it below. (Facebook also has a new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSji6Y66aKo\">video</a> explaining how to control what shows up in Graph Search.)</p><h3>What's public on my profile?</h3><p>Click on the lock in the top menu bar, and under \"Who can see my stuff?\" click \"View As.\" This will take you to the public view of your profile. Here you can see exactly what information, photos, and posts are available to the public. If there's anything you don't want the whole Facebook universe to be able to see, you can change individual settings to hide particular items.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook1.png\"><h3>How do I hide my general information?</h3><p>Go to your profile page and click \"Update Info.\" You can control who is able to see what personal information you've listed—and if they're able to see it, they're able to search it.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook2.png\"><h3>Who can see my posts, both past and future?</h3><p>You can access your <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy\">privacy settings</a> by clicking on the lock in the top menu bar, then clicking \"See More Settings.\" From here, you can choose your audience for future posts (including photos), and you can also limit who has access to previous posts that were more widely accessible.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook3.png\"><h3>How do I hide my photo albums?</h3><p>Go to your profile page and click on \"Photos,\" then \"Albums.\" You can configure who has access to each album.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook4.png\"><p>Note that tagging others in a photo by default gives their friends the ability to see that photo. Also note that removing a photo from your Timeline does not remove it from being searched, especially if it is someone else's photo.</p><p>In order to make sure that photo is not searchable, you must detag yourself or report the photo. Facebook has another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaJYQXiu3PY\">great video</a> about how to do just this.</p><p>To detag yourself, click on a photo, and on the bottom of the picture click on \"Options.\" Next, click \"Report/Remove Tag.\" This gives you the option to remove your tag, as well as to notify the poster that you'd like the photo to be taken down.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook6.png\"><img src=\"tool_facebook5.png\"><h3>How do I hide my \"Likes\"?</h3><p>Go to your profile page and click on \"Likes.\" Click \"Edit\" on the top right. From there, you can edit who can see your liked pages in each individual category.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook7.png\"><h3>Do I actually \"Like\" these things?</h3><p>While you are configuring your \"Likes,\" we encourage you to take a moment to reassess the pages you have listed. A few years later, you may not like \"Free Booze Fridays\" anymore. Unliking is as simple as going to a particular page, hovering your mouse over \"Liked,\" and clicking \"Unlike.\"</p><img src=\"tool_facebook8.png\"><h3>How do I hide my friends and relationships?</h3><p>Besides locking down your own personal information, it turns out that your friends and relationships can appear in searches associated with you. Because <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/facebook-graph-search-privacy-control-you-still-dont-have\">they have no control</a> over how they appear in such searches, we strongly encourage you to do the altruistic thing and lock down your friendship settings. Here's how to set your privacy settings to keep your friendships and relationships—and therefore related search results—limited in visibility to only whom you want.</p><p>First, go to your profile and click on \"Friends.\" On the top right of the page, click on the \"Edit\" button. This allows you to select who can see your friend list.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook9.png\"><p>Next, you should adjust the settings of your relationships and family associations. Go to your profile and click \"Update Info,\" then scroll down to \"Family\" on the bottom left. When you click \"Edit,\" you can choose the specific privacy settings for each relationship.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook10.png\"><h3>Keep it up!</h3><p>The most important think you can do is to check your privacy settings often—especially after new features are released. Facebook has done a better job of making new privacy settings more accessible while also notifying users of any changes. Their explanations, however, can lose sight of bigger picture concerns.</p><h1>HOW TO HOW TO OPT-OUT OF FACEBOOK'S DATA BROKER RELATIONSHIPS</h1><h2>How to opt-out of Facebook's data broker relationships</h2><p><b>Lesson to read: <a href=\"umbrella://lesson/social-media\">Social Media</a></b><br><b>Other reading:</b> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/4-simple-changes-protect-your-privacy-online\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/4-simple-changes-protect-your-privacy-online</a><br><b>Level:</b> Beginner<br><b>Time required:</b> 30 minutes</p><p>Facebook is teaming up with four of the world’s largest corporate data brokers to “enhance” the ad experience for users. Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai obtain information gathered about users through online means (such as through cookies when users surf the web) as well as through offline means (such as through loyalty cards at supermarkets and product warranty cards).  Facebook will use this information to tailor its ads. The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes what this means and how you can avoid it.</p><p>In practical terms, this means that limiting how much information you put on Facebook is not enough to limit how ads are targeted to you on Facebook. Your interests, age, shopping history (including offline), web browsing, location, and much more could be stored by these data brokers and utilized to market to you – even if you’ve been careful not to share this type of information with Facebook.</p><p>So, what can users do? If you’re concerned about this practice, you can opt out of the targeted advertisements by individually visiting each of the data broker partners currently working with Facebook. We've got directions below for opting out of each site.</p><p>We also have two general tips:</p><p><b>1.  Install an add-on to protect your privacy online.</b> Facebook is using \"blind cookie-matching\" to match up users of online marketer BlueKai with specific Facebook accounts. Blocking trackers is a good general practice for stopping this type of tracking. We recommend you use a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.ghostery.com/\">Ghostery</a> (now available on Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer).</p><p><b>2. Avoid giving your phone number and email address to companies when possible.</b> Facebook and these companies are primarily using hashed email addresses to match users between databases, though they may also use hashed phone numbers. If you’re filling out a survey or signing up to receive email updates from a website, consider creating and using a different email address than the one you associate with your Facebook account. Similarly, consider setting up an alternate phone number you can give to companies apart from the phone number you connect with your social media accounts.</p><h3>Opt Out Instructions:</h3><p>Note that in general, opting out of data brokers will not necessarily result in your data being removed from their lists. Instead, these companies will generally 'suppress' your information from certain uses -- including, hopefully, in the batches of data sent to Facebook. The process below takes a bit of effort, but you really do need to opt out of all four data brokers separately to get out of this program.</p><p><b>Acxiom</b></p><p>1. To get started, visit Acxiom's <a href=\"https://isapps.acxiom.com/optout/optout.aspx\">Opt Out Form</a>. Then scroll down until you see your \"opt-out choices.\" Here there will be a list of the types of media you would like to opt out of (mail, telemarketing, email, and online advertising).  You can check all four, though note that their online advertising opt-out is cookie-based, meaning it will disappear every time you clear your cookies. </p><img src=\"tool_facebook11.png\"><p>2. Certify that you are just a single person.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook12.png\"><p>3. Fill out the form with your personal information. In order to be sure that Acxiom doesn't target advertisements at you through Facebook, you'll want to provide Acxiom with the phone number and email address associated with your Facebook profile. Use the green + signs on the form to add information.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook13.png\"><p>4. Click submit. After you hit submit (and get through a CAPTCHA), you'll be offered a chance to install Acxiom's opt out cookie. You can choose to do this or not, but remember that this is not a persistent method of protecting your privacy: the opt out cookie will disappear as soon as you clear your cookies. See instructions below for opting out of BlueKai for advice on dealing with web tracking.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook14.png\"><p>5.  You will then receive an email with a link in it from Acxiom. You can click on this link or else copy and paste it into a new browser window. Visiting this page will take you to another CAPTCHA. Fill this out.</p><p>Congratulations - you've opted out of Acxiom!</p><p><b>Datalogix</b></p><p>1. To opt out of this program, visit the Datalogix.com <a href=\"https://www.datalogix.com/privacy/\">privacy page</a>. Scroll down to the word “Choice” and the last sentence in the first paragraph says:</p><p><i>“If you wish to opt out of all Datalogix-enabled advertising across channels including direct mail, online, mobile and analytic products, click here.”</i></p><p>2. Click there and a form will pop up that asks for your name, address, and email address. Fill this out and click submit.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook15.png\"><p>Datalogix promises that the opt-out will take effect within 30 days. Once you’ve been opted out, Datalogix will no longer include your information in the hashed data they provide to Facebook. </p><p><b>Epsilon</b></p><p>As Epsilon explains on their <a href=\"www.epsilon.com/consumer-preference-center\">Consumer Preference Center</a> page, there are several ways to opt out of the Epsilon marketing database: </p><p><b>EMAIL:</b> Email <a href=\"mailto:optout@epsilon.com\">optout@epsilon.com</a> and include the following information:<br>• full name (including middle initial)<br>• current address<br>• previous address if you have been at your current address fewer than six months</p><p><b>PHONE:</b> Phone 1.888.780.3869 and leave the above information.</p><p><b>MAIL:</b> Mail the above information to the below addresses:<br><b>U.S. Consumers:</b> Epsilon<br>\u2028P.O. Box 1478<br>\u2028Broomfield, CO 80036<br><b>Canadian Consumers:</b> Epsilon\u2028<br>41 Metropolitan Rd.\u2028<br>Toronto, Ontario<br>\u2028M1R 2T5</p><p>We note that not all of these methods require you to provide an email address.  Epsilon may have methods to match your name with your email, but you can also provide your email address to be sure.</p><p>Note that opting out doesn't actually remove the data from Epsilon's database but rather just marks it as \"suppressed\" to they will stop sharing it for marketing purposes. This means that if the information is ever re-submitted, you won't be added back to the list.</p><p><b>BlueKai</b></p><p>Unlike the other data brokers Facebook is working with on this new project, BlueKai does not directly collect data from your offline activities. Instead, they use tracking cookies that collect data about your online browsing habits and then use that information to infer what types of products you might like to buy.</p><p><b>The best way to opt out of this is to use a browser add-on to block third-party tracking.</b><br>Rather than try to block only BlueKai, we recommend you block all third-party trackers. You can use a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.ghostery.com/\">Ghostery</a> (now available on Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer) as noted earlier.</p><p><b>CONGRATULATIONS</b> -- you've managed to get out of Facebook's new data broker-driven targeted marketing, and helped protect yourself from several important data brokers.  </p>\n"));

If it does, click “Next” to activate the <i>Windows Installer</i> screen, followed by the <i>Welcome to the Jitsi Setup Wizard</i> window.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Next” to activate the <i>End User License Agreement</i> window; check the <i>I accept the terms in the License Agreement</i> option to enable the <i>Next</i> button, and then click “Next” to activate the <i>Destination Folder</i> window.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Next” to activate the <i>Additional Tasks</i> window and accept the default settings as presented.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Enabling the <i>Auto-start when computer restarts or reboots</i> option may slow down the overall function of your computer, especially if you already have multiple applications configured to run when your computer starts up.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Click “Next” to activate the <i>Ready to Install Jitsi</i> window, and then click “Install” to activate the <i>Installing Jitsi</i> window displaying the installation progress bar.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Finish” to complete the installation process and automatically launch the <b>Jitsi</b> <i>Sign in</i> window as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi1.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> In some instances, installing and launching Jitsi for the first time triggers a <i>Windows Security Alert</i> prompt screen, as shown below. </p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Select both <b>Private</b> and <b>Public</b> networks check-boxes, and then click <i>Allow access</i>*** to see the <i>Jitsi Sign in window</i> or main user interface window.</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi2.png\"><h3>2.2 How to Add Accounts in Jitsi</h3><p>Please note that even with Jitsi encryption, account providers like Google or Facebook are monitoring the very fact that you are communicating (and perhaps with whom you are communicating), and may share this information with third-parties, such as corporations or governments. Therefore it is perhaps best to avoid using those accounts for very sensitive communication even with Jitsi encryption. </p><h3>2.2.1 How to Add a Gmail/Google Account</h3><p><b>Note:</b> The example which follows is based on a Google Talk account, the set-up process for the other communication protocols is similar. Communications or some encryption features may not work between users of different account providers (like Facebook, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.). However, they should work when communicating between two accounts from the same provider.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select <b>Start > Jitsi</b> or double-click the Jitsi desktop icon to open Jitsi.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> In the <i>sign in</i> window, type in the username and password of the Gmail account you would like to use for chat purposes, so that it resembles the following:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi3.png\"><p><b> Note:</b> You can add multiple accounts using different protocols at the same time.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Sign in” to activate your account chat window.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you closed <i>Sign in</i> window, or you want to add another account, you can add it by selecting <b><i>File > Add new account...</i></b> menu. In the new window select <b>Network</b> as <i>Google Talk</i> and type in the user name and password of the Gmail account as shown on the image below:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi4.png\"><p>To verify that you have registered your Gmail account with Jitsi, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select <b>Tools > Options</b> in the menu to activate the following window:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi5.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> If you are using 2-step verification to protect access to your Gmail account, when you try to log in from Jitsi with your regular password you may see a message like the one below. To log in using Jitsi, you will need to generate an \"application-specific password\". See Google's <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en\">instructions on how to do this</a>.</p><h3>2.2.2 Registering new Jabber/XMPP or SIP account and adding it to Jitsi<h3><p>Jabber/XMPP and SIP are open standards of text and voice communication. There are many servers that offer free accounts which you can use with Jitsi. Below we are recommending some of the servers that you could use for sensitive communication. </p><p>• <b>Riseup.net</b> Jabber/XMPP account</p><p>If you have account on the Riseup.net secure email service (located in the USA) you may use this account also to communicate over Jabber/XMPP network by adding this account to Jitsi - see below on how to add existing Jabber/XMPP account.</p><p>• <b>Jabber.ccc.de</b> and other Jabber/XMPP accounts</p><p>You can register an account on Jabber.ccc.de server (located in Germany) by taking following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> In Jitsi, select <b><i>File > Add new account...</i></b> in the menu. In the new window, select <b><i>Network:</i> XMPP</b> and check the <i>Create a new XMPP account*** option</i>. In <i>*Server</i>, type jabber.ccc.de, type in the XMPP username you would like to create, and fill in the <i>Password</i> and <i>Confirm</i> password fields so that it resembles the following:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi6.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click <b>Add</b>. After successful registration you will be presented with a window similar to that above.<p><p>If the username which you requested is already taken by somebody else, the registration process will fail with the message <i>We failed to create your account due to the following error: Could not confirm data</i>. You can try again by repeating the process and selecting a different username.</p><p><b>Note</b> that if you do not log in to your jabber.ccc.de for longer than 12 months your account will be automatically removed from the server and the username will become available for registration by other people.</p><p>• <b>ostel.co</b> SIP account</p><p><b>SIP</b> accounts cannot be registered from within the Jitsi program. The <b>ostel.co</b> server (located in USA) offers <a href=\"https://ostel.co/users/sign_up\">registration on their web page</a>. Select a username, password and provide your existing email address and click the <i>Sign up</i> button on the web page. After successful registration come back to Jitsi program. Select <b><i>File > Add new account...</i></b> in the menu, select <b>Network: SIP</b>, type in your username (e.g. terence.the.tester@ostel.co) and the password you created during the web registration and click <b><i>Add</i></b>. See following image for reference:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi7.png\"><p>• <b>Adding existing Jabber/XMPP or SIP account to Jitsi</b></p><p>If you already have Jabber/XMPP or SIP account you can add it to Jitsi by selecting <b><i>File > Add new account...</i></b> in the menu and selecting the appropriate Network (either XMPP or SIP depending on the account type).</p><h3>2.2.3 How to Add a Facebook Account</h3><p>Facebook has two settings that you may need to change before Jitsi can connect to your Facebook Chat.</p><p>• <b>Facebook Username</b></p><p>Facebook requires a username for Jitsi to connect to Facebook chat. Many Facebook users already have a username. To check your username, log in to your Facebook account: your username is what appear in the location bar of your browser after <i>https://www.facebook.com/</i> when you view your Timeline or Page. Your username is also in your Facebook email address for your personal account (ex: username@facebook.com). You can see or change the username or get one by going to your <i>Account Settings > General</i> section or by visiting <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/username\">https://www.facebook.com/username</a>. To set username Facebook may ask you for your account verification which may require sending SMS to a mobile phone number which you will need to provide to Facebook in the process of verification.</p><p>• <b>App Settings</b></p><p>Facebook’s “application platform” must be turned on before <b>Jitsi</b> can connect to Facebook Chat. Visit your Facebook <i>Account Settings > Apps</i> section and check that the setting for Apps you use is turned On. This turns \"application platform\" on for your account.</p><p><b>Note</b> that that turning Facebook’s \"application platform\" opens up much of your Facebook data to third-party application developers. This data is available not only to the Facebook applications that you use, but also Facebook applications used by any of your friends. After turning on Facebook’s \"application platform\", be sure to check the settings under \"Apps others use\". This setting allows you to hide some personal information from applications used by your friends. Unfortunately, Facebook does not offer settings to hide all personal information. Certain categories of information (like your friend list, gender, or info you have made public) are visible as long as Facebook’s \"application platform\" is turned \"on\". It is up to you to determine whether this is an acceptable tradeoff of your privacy.</p><p>Now you are prepared to add your Facebook account to Jitsi. To do this follow the steps below:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> From the main menu select <b><i>File > Add New Account...</i></b></p><p><b>Step 2.</b> In the Add New Account dialogue, <b>Network</b> menu choose <i>Facebook</i>, enter your username and password and Click <b>\"Add\"</b></p><img src=\"tool_jitsi8.png\"><h3>2.3 How to change password for account with Jitsi</h3><p>It is important element of security to know how to change the password for each account that one has. Many of the accounts that you can use with Jitsi offer changing password as a part of their settings, which are accessible over web interface. However some Jabber/XMPP and SIP account will not have any web interface to manage them. You can change password for those account using Jitsi by following steps below:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select <b><i>Tools > Options</i></b> in the menu, select the <b><i>Accounts</i></b> tab</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click on <b><i>Edit</i></b> button on the bottom to activate a new window.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click on <b><i>Change account password</i></n> to activate <i>Change account password</i> window.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Enter new password and Re-enter password and click on <b><i>OK</i></b> button to close this window.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Close Account Registration Wizard.</p><h3>2.4 How to configure Jitsi to improve it's security</h3><h3>2.4.1 Disable and remove call and chat history</h3><p>Jitsi by default stores information about the incoming and outgoing voice/video calls and the history of your text chats -- all messages that you sent and received. You can access voice/video calls by clicking on the clock icon on the main Jitsi window:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi9.png\"><p>You can see the text chat history by clicking on the egg-timer like icon in the text chat window while chatting with a contact:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi10.png\"></p>Even if you encrypt the text chat with OTR all the text messages you send and receive are stored on your computer in open text format.</p><p> To prevent Jitsi collecting this information (and remove already gathered data), you and your contact should take the following steps.</p><p><b>To disable Jitsi from collecting the information:</b></p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select <b><i>Tools > Options</b></i> in the menu, select the <b><i>General</i></b> tab and uncheck the <b><i>Log chat history</i></b> option.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> in the <i>Options</i> window, first <b>select the Advanced</b> tab, then <b>select the <i>Logging</i></b> section, and then <b>uncheck the <i>Enable packet logging</i></b> option as shown below:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi11.png\"><p>Your changes will take effect after you restart Jitsi.</p><p><b>To remove already collected information about your calls and text messages:</b></p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Quit Jitsi.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Remove the entire log history folder <i>history_ver1.0</i> from the Jitsi user profile folder. You can remove a sub-folder of <i>history_ver1.0</i> if you want to dispose of only part of the history. The location of the <i>user profile</i> and <i>log history</i> folders depends on the operating system:<p><p>• On Windows XP and earlier, this is located in <i>C:\\Documents and Settings\\&lt;Windows login/user name&gt;\\Application Data\\Jitsi\\history_ver1.0</i><br>• On Windows Vista, 7, 8, this is <i>C:\\Users\\&lt;Windows login/user name&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Jitsi\\history_ver1.0</i><br>• Mac OS X: from your home folder <i>~/Library/Application Support/Jitsi/history_ver1.0</i><br>• Linux: from your home folder <i>~/.jitsi/history_ver1.0</i></p><p>See the <a href=\"umbrealla://lesson/safely-deleting\">Secure Deleting lesson</a> for more on how to dispose of information securely.</p><h3>2.4.2 Require private messaging when text chatting</h3><p>It is recommended that you set Jitsi up to require private and encrypted text messaging using OTR encryption whenever possible. To do this, select <b><i>Tools > Options</i></b> in the menu, select the <b><i>Security</i></b> tab, select the <b><i>Chat</i> sub-tab and check <b><i>Require private messaging</i></b> at the bottom of the screen.</p><h3>2.4.3 Protect passwords to your accounts with master password</h3><p>It is best not to let Jitsi remember passwords to your accounts. If you decide otherwise for ease of use anybody who gets access to your computer will be able to log in to your accounts by simply starting Jitsi. It will also be possible to view your passwords in the Options window. It is therefore <b>strongly recommended</b> to protect passwords to your accounts with good master password. Once you set up the master password, Jitsi will ask you for it upon starting the program.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Open the Options window by selecting <b><i>Tools > Options</i></b> in the menu, select the <b><i>Security</i></b> tab and <b><i>Passwords</i></b> sub-tab, and check <b><i>Use a master password</i></b> to activate the <b><i>Master Password</i></b> window.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> In the new window, type in your password. For more on creating a strong password, see the <b><a href=\"umbrella://lesson/passwords\">Password lesson</a></b>.</p><p><b>Step 3. Click <i>OK</i></b> to confirm the password and activate a new window which should say <b><i>Master Password successfully set up</i></b>. Click \"<b>OK<b>\" to close it and come back to the <i>Options</i> window which should resemble below:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi12.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> The <b><i>Change Master Password</i></b> button lets you change the master password and the <b><i>Saved Passwords...</i></b> button lets you access the list of passwords remembered by Jitsi and remove them if need be.</p><h3>Jitsi - Add contacts and communicate text & voice</h3><h3>3.1 Add contacts (buddies) to Jitsi</h3><p>After adding at least one account to Jitsi and logging in, you are ready to add your contacts and communicate with them.</p><p><b>Step 0.</b> Open the Jitsi main window by selecting <b><i>Start > Jitsi</i></b> or double-clicking the Jitsi desktop icon.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select <b><i>File > Add contact...</i></b> which will open the following window:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi13.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select which of your accounts you would like to add this contact to (for example <i>terance.the.tester@jit.si</i>).</p><p><b>Optional:</b> You may also add the contact to a group among your other contacts. However, first you must create the group. You can do this by selecting <b><i>File > Create group...</b></i> from the menu).</p><p>Type in your contact's user name or address into the <b><i>ID or Number</i></b> field (for example, <i>sally.the.doer@jit.si</i>).</p><p>You can choose the name or nickname for the contact, which will be visible in your contacts list in the Jitsi main window; type it into the <b><i>Display name</i></b> field.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click on <i>Add</i> to close the <i>Add contact</i> window and come back to Jitsi main window. In your contact list you will now see your new contact added with the note \"Waiting for authorisation\".</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> When your contact (sally.the.doer@jit.si) logs in to her account, a pop-up window will inform her that you have requested to add her to your list of contacts:</p><p>Your contact has a choice of selecting the <i>Ignore</i> option, in which case your request will continue awaiting authorisation; <i>Deny</i>, in which case you will receive information that your request was rejected; and <i>Authorise</i>, in which case you will receive information that your contact has accepted your authorisation request, and the entry for your contact in your contact list will become active.</p><h3>3.2 Text chat (Instant Messaging) with OTR encryption</h3><p>Now that you added and authorised your contact, you can click on their name in the contact list and initiate text conversation, voice or video calls, and desktop sharing, by choosing the relevant icon under their name:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi14.png\"><p>Step 1. We will now explore one of Jitsi's most important features: the ability to text chat securely, encrypting your messages with OTR. OTR functions in a similar manner to GPG/PGP described in other chapters in this toolkit. Just as with PGP, before you and your contact can encrypt your communications, you both need to configure Jitsi to generate your encryption keys. You can do this by selecting <b><i>Tools > Options</i></b> menu and selecting the <b><i>Security</i></b> tab and <b><i>Chat</i></b> sub-tab. You will then see a window similar to one shown in the image below:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi15.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Next, click the <b><i>Generate</i></b> button. As a result you will see the fingerprint of the key that has been generated:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi16.png\"><p>One key is generated per account. You only need to do this again if you add a new account or install Jitsi on another device and do not move the existing keys to it.</p><p>Now you are ready to communicate:</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Select a contact from Jitsi main window and click on the <i>send message</i> icon (first from the left under the contact's name) to open a text chat window:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi17.png\"><p>Note the <i>Encrypt chat with OTR</i> icon, the open padlock on the right-top side of the window. This inconspicuous symbol informs you whether the chat is encrypted or not. Now the lock is open (there is a tiny space between handle and the body of the lock!).</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Click on the <b><i>Encrypt chat with OTR</b></i> icon. Note the changes in the window:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi18.png\"><p><p>Observe that the padlock is now locked. This means that whatever messages you and your contact send to each other are encrypted. Note the message that this is an <i>unverified private</i> conversation and that you should <i>authenticate</i> sally.the.doer@jit.si.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click on the link <b><i>authenticate sally.the.doer@jit.si</i></b> to open the <i>Authenticate Buddy</i> window:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi19.png\"><p>Note the message that encourages you to compare the fingerprints of your keys with your contact over another channel (not this text chat). In doing this, you can be more certain that you are communicating with your contact and not somebody else. A good choice for key comparisons is to do it face to face, or via video or voice communication as these provide easier means to authenticate the identity of the other person. After you compare fingerprints, select the option <b><i>I have verified</i></b> the fingerprint from the pull-down menu and click on <b><i>Authenticate Buddy</i></b>:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi20.png\"><p>Closing the <i>Authenticate Buddy</i> window returns you to the chat window.</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi21.png\"><p>Note that padlock no longer includes the orange triangle with the white exclamation mark. This means that you have authenticated your contact. <b>The authentication should be done only once per contact.</b> If the triangle with exclamation mark returns, it means that you are chatting to somebody who you have not yet authenticated. This can happen when your contact moves to another device with another encryption key (another installation of Jitsi, or another OTR enabled program, etc.). In this case you will need to re-authenticate each other again to be sure of the identity of person with whom you communicate.</p><p>Jitsi allows you to text chat with more than one person in the same time. OTR encryption will only work when chatting to one person.</p><h3>3.3 Voice and video chat with ZRTP encryption</h3><p>Jitsi offers voice and video chats which can be independently encrypted with open standard called ZRTP. In order to initiate the chat you need to</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click on the contact in Jitsi contact list and click on the voice (second icon from the left under the contact's name) or video (third) icon. A new window will appear indicating that Jitsi is establishing the connection:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi22.png\"><p>Your contact will see an incoming call notification.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> If your contact accepts the call you will receive information that you are connected:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi23.png\"><p><b>Note</b> the red open padlock. This means that your call is not yet encrypted with ZRTP.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Wait... Your and your contact's programs are establishing an encrypted connection, which may take a moment. If they succeed you will see the letters <i>zrtp</i> appear against an orange background with a closed padlock like below. If they don't succeed in establishing a connection, you still can chat but without encryption. You can disconnect, restart Jitsi and try again to see if this time the programs will connect with encryption. ZRTP may not work in calls between accounts from different providers (such as between Google and Jit.si).</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi24.png\"><p><b>Step 4.</b> Observe the section under the letters <i>zrtp</i> and padlock with the message \"Compare with partner\" followed by 4 characters. Read these letters to your contact and ask if she sees the same characters. If she does, it means that your communication is encrypted and nobody is interfering with it. You can click <b><i>Confirm</i></b>. The orange <i>zrtp</i> field will turn green:</p><img src=\"tool_jitsi25.png\"><p><b>Step 5.</b> You may close the black confirmation section of the window by clicking on the white x sign on upper-right part of the black section:</p><p>Jitsi lets you voice and video chat with more than one person. Note that with this communication, ZRTP encryption can be engaged between initiator of the call and other parties, but not between parties themselves.</p>"));

Press “Next” to begin the account setup.</p><p>Where possible, K-9 Mail will attempt to automatically configure your email account for you. If this is not possible or you wish to have more control over the account setup you can also manually configure your account.</p><h3>2.1.1 Automatic account setup</h3><p><b>Step 1:</b> Enter your email address and email password in the fields provided and tap “Next”.</p><img src=\"tool_k930.png\"><p><b>Step 2: K-9 Mail</b> will connect to the internet and attempt to get your account settings.</p><p><b>Step 3:</b> Once the settings have been retrieved you will be asked to enter your name as you want it to be displayed on all outgoing email and to give the account a name. The account name will allow you to distinguish between multiple accounts, should you want to add more. Tap “Done” to complete the account setup.</p><img src=\"tool_k931.png\"><p><b>Step 4:</b> K-9 Mail will display changes to the program since the last version, tap “OK” to dismiss this window and be brought to your mail account.</p><img src=\"tool_k932.png\"><p><b>Step 5:</b> To make sure the account is working in K-9 Mail, send yourself an email from your computer and download it from the K-9 Mail client.</p><h3>2.1.2 Manual account setup</h3><p><b>Step 1:</b> Enter your email address and email password in the fields provided and tap “Manual setup”.</p><p><b>Step 2:</b> Select the account type your email is (IMAP/POP/Exchange) and tap the relevant button as in the image below.</p><p><b>Note:</b> you will need to refer to your email client settings on your computer to know what account type your email server uses.</p><img src=\"tool_k933.png\"><p><b>Step 3:</b> Next are the incoming server settings. If unsure, refer to the email client on your computer for settings. Always ensure that the <i>security type</i> is set to either <i>STARTTLS</i> or <i>SSL/TLS</i>. <b>Never</b> use the <i>none</i> option.</p><img src=\"tool_k934.png\"><p><b>Step 4. K-9 Mail</b> will then connect to your mail server to check if your settings are correct. It might display a warning about the certificate of your secured connection. <i>Do not ignore this!</i> This is the only time you can verify that the certificate really belongs to your mail server. If you ignore this, you can not be sure if you are not subject to a <i>Man-in-the-Middle attack</i>, and your communications could be intercepted. You can see a SHA-1 fingerprint at the very end of the warning. Either <b>check</b> on your computer if the installed certificate from your mail server has the same fingerprint, or find a way to check your mail server's certificate directly from your provider.</p><p><b>Step 5. K-9 Mail</b> asks you to configure your outgoing server settings. Again, <b>ensure</b> that <i>Security Type</i> is <i>STARTTLS</i> or <i>SSL/TLS</i>. For all additional settings, <b>check</b> your computer's email client or the settings of your email provider.</p><img src=\"tool_k935.png\"><p><b>Step 6.</b> K-9 Mail now asks you how often you want it to automatically poll for email. Set the option to <i>never</i> and uncheck <i>enable push mail</i> for this account, if you only want to receive email when you manually check, otherwise leave the settings as they are to automatically receive email as they arrive to your account.</p><img src=\"tool_k936.png\"><p><b>Step 7.</b> The last pieces of information to provide are a nickname for the email account which will be displayed in K-9 Mail and to set up the name you wish to be displayed on all outgoing email. </p><p><b>Step 8:</b> To make sure the account is working in K-9 Mail, send yourself an email from your computer and download it from the K-9 Mail client.</p><p>We recommend that you use K-9 Mail only in addition to your computer's email client. Therefore it is important that when you download email with your Android phone, it does not delete the email on the server, since you want to receive the email later with your computer, too. By default, K-9 Mail is set up this way, but you may want to learn more about the settings which can be found in <i>accounts</i>; this can be reached by long pressing on the account you have just set up and selecting <i>account settings</i> from the menu. You may also wish to check the <i>fetching mail</i> and <i>sending mail</i> account option for settings.</p><h3>2.2 How to Send and Receive Encrypted eMail</h3><p>One of the main benefits of using K-9 Mail over other email clients is that it lets you send and receive GPG encrypted email. Before you can start sending and receiving encrypted email, you need to ensure that you have all your OpenPGP keys imported into APG, as outlined in the APG section above. If you followed all the necessary steps in the APG keys section your keys will be imported.</p><h3> 2.2.1 Sending encrypted email</h3><p><b>Step 1:</b> From any screen in K-9 Mail tap the Send Email icon to start a new email.</p><p><b>Step 2:</b> On the email composition screen add your recipient by either typing in an email address or pressing the Add Recipient icon and selecting one from your address book.</p><p><b>Step 3:</b> Enable encrypted email by checking the box next to <i>encrypt</i>.</p><p><b>Step 4:</b> When finished writing your email, press the Send icon to send.</p><img src=\"tool_k937.png\"><p><b>Step 5:</b> The following screen will ask you to select which GPG keys to encrypt to.

This is explained in the APG encryption section above. To attach the files tap the paperclip attachment icon and select the encrypted file (ending in <i>.gpg</i>).</p><h3>2.2.2 Receiving encrypted email</h3><p><b>Step 1:</b> Open your <i>inbox</i> and tap the email you wish to read.</p><img src=\"tool_k939.png\"><p><b>Step 2:</b> Tap the “Decrypt” button.</p><img src=\"tool_k940.png\"><p><b>Step 3:</b> Enter the passphrase for your GPG key when prompted and press “OK” to decrypt the email.</p><img src=\"tool_k941.png\"></p><p><b>Note:</b> as <b>K-9 Mail</b> is currently not able to decrypt encrypted attachments, you will need to save the attachments to your phone and decrypt them with APG, as explained in the APG decryption section above. </p>"));

A password safe is a great tool because it allows you to use different difficult-to-guess passwords for all your services, without needing to remember them. Instead, you only need to remember one master password that allows you to decrypt a database of all your passwords. Password safes are convenient and allow you to organize all of your passwords in one location.</p><p><b>It should be noted that using a password safe creates a single point of failure and establishes an obvious target for bad actors or adversaries. Research has suggested that many commonly used passwords safes have vulnerabilities, so use caution when determining whether or not this is the right tool for you.</b></p><h3>1.1 How KeePassX works</h3><p>KeePassX works with files called password databases, which are exactly what they sound like—files that store a database of all your passwords. These databases are encrypted when they’re stored on your computer’s hard disk, so if your computer is off and someone steals it they won’t be able to read your passwords.</p><p>Password databases can be encrypted via three methods: using a master password, using a keyfile, or both. Let’s look at the pros and cons of each.</p><h3>1.2 Using a master password</h3><p>A master password acts like a key—in order to open the password database, you need the correct master password. Without it, nobody can see what’s inside the password database. There are a few things to keep in mind when using a master password to secure your password database.</p><p>• <i>This password will decrypt all of your passwords, so it needs to be strong!</i> That means it shouldn’t be something easy to guess, and it should also be long—the longer the better! Also, the longer it is, the less you need to worry about having special characters or capitals or numbers. A password that is only made up of six random words (in all lower case, with spaces in between) can be harder to break than a 12-character password made up of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.<br>• <i>You need to be able to remember this password!</i> Since this one password will allow access to all your other passwords, you need to be able to make sure you can remember it without writing it down. This is another reason to use something like <a href=\"http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html\">Diceware</a>—you can use regular words that are easy to remember, instead of trying to remember unnatural combinations of symbols and capital letters.</p><h3>1.3 Using a keyfile</h3><p>Alternatively, you can use a keyfile to encrypt your password database. A keyfile acts the same way a password would—every time you want to decrypt your password database you will need to provide that keyfile to KeePassX. A keyfile should be stored on a USB drive or some other portable media, and only inserted into your computer when you want to open your password database. The benefit of this is that even if somebody gets access to your computer’s hard disk (and thus your password database) they still won’t be able to decrypt it without the keyfile stored in the external media. (Additionally, a keyfile can be much harder for an adversary to guess than a normal password.) The downside is that any time you want to access your password database, you’ll need to have that external media handy (and if you lose it or it gets damaged, then you won’t be able to open your password database).</p><p>Using a keyfile instead of a password is the closest thing to having an actual physical key to open your password database—all you need to do is insert your USB drive, select the keyfile, and presto! If you do choose to use a keyfile instead of a master password, though, make sure your USB drive is stored somewhere safe—<i>anyone who finds it will be able to open your password database</i>.</p><h3>1.4 Using both</h3><p>The most secure method for encrypting your password database is to use both a master password and a keyfile. This way, your ability to decrypt your password database depends on what you know (your master password) and what you have (your keyfile)—and any malicious entity who wants to get access to your passwords will need both. (With that said, keep in mind your threat model—for most home users who just want to store their passwords, a strong master password should be sufficient. But if you’re worried about protecting against state-level actors with access to huge computational resources, then the more security the better.)</p><p>Now that you understand how KeePassX works, let’s get started with actually using it!</p><h3>2.0 Getting started with KeePassX</h3><p>Once you’ve installed KeePassX from <a href=\"https://www.keepassx.org/downloads\">here</a>, go ahead and launch it. </p><p>Once it’s started, select “New Database” from the File menu. </p><p>A dialog will pop up which will ask you to enter a master password and/or use a keyfile. Select the appropriate checkbox(es) based on your choice. </p><p>Note that if you want to see the password you’re typing in (instead of obscuring it with dots) you can click the button with the “eye” to the right. </p><p>Also note that you can use any existing file as a keyfile—an image of your cat for example, could be used as a keyfile. You’ll just need to make sure the file you choose never gets modified, because if its contents are changed then it will no longer work for decrypting your password database. </p><p>Also be aware that sometimes opening a file in another program can be enough to modify it; the best practice is to not open the file except to unlock KeePassX. (It is safe to move or rename the keyfile, though.)</p><p>Once you’ve successfully initialized your password database, you should save it by choosing “Save Database” from the File menu. (Note that if you want, you can move the password database file later to wherever you like on your hard disk, or move it to other computers—you’ll still be able to open it using KeePassX and the password/keyfile you specified before.)</p><h3>2.1 Organizing passwords</h3><p>KeePassX allows you to organize passwords into “Groups,” which are basically just folders. You can create, delete, or edit Groups or Subgroups by going to the “Groups” menu in the menubar, or by right-clicking on a Group in the left-hand pane of the KeePassX window. Grouping passwords doesn’t affect any of the functionality of KeePassX—it’s just a handy organizational tool.</p><h3>2.2 Storing/generating/editing passwords</h3><p>To create a new password or store a password you already have, right-click on the Group in which you want to store the password, and choose “Add New Entry” (you can also choose “Entries > Add New Entry” from the menubar). For basic password usage, do the following:</p><p>• Enter a descriptive title you can use to recognize this password entry in the “Title” field.<br>• Enter the username associated with this password entry in the “Username” field. (This can be blank if there is no username.)<br>• Enter your password in the “Password” field. If you’re creating a new password (i.e. if you’re signing up for a new website and you want to create a new, unique, random password) click the “Gen” button to the right. This will pop up a password generator dialog, which you can use to generate a random password. There are several options in this dialog, including what sorts of characters to include and how long to make the password.<br> * Note that if you generate a random password, it’s not necessary that you remember (or even know!) what that password is! KeePassX stores it for you, and any time you need it you’ll be able to copy/paste it into the appropriate program. This is the whole point of a password safe—you can use different long random passwords for <i>each</i> website/service, without even knowing what the passwords are!<br> * Because of this, you should make the password as long as the service will allow and use as many different types of characters as possible.<br> * Once you’re satisfied with the options, click “Generate” in the lower right to generate the password, and then click “OK.” The generated random password will automatically be entered in the “Password” and “Repeat” fields for you. (If you’re not generating a random password, then you’ll need to enter your chosen password again in the “Repeat” field.)<br>• Finally, click “OK”. Your password is now stored in your password database. To make sure the changes are saved, be sure to save the edited password database by going to “File > Save Database.” (Alternatively, if you made a mistake, you can close and then re-open the database file and all changes will be lost.)</p><p>If you ever need to change/edit the stored password, you can just choose the Group it’s in and then double-click on its title in the right-hand pane, and the “New Entry” dialog will pop up again.</p><h3>2.3 Normal use</h3><p>In order to use an entry in your password database, simply right-click on the entry and choose “Copy Username to Clipboard” or “Copy Password to Clipboard,” and then go to the window/website where you want to enter your username/password, and simply paste in the appropriate field. (Instead of right-clicking on the entry, you can also double-click on the username or password of the entry you want, and the username or password will be automatically copied to your clipboard.)</p><h3>2.4 Advanced use</h3><p>One of the most useful features of KeePassX is that it can automatically type in usernames and passwords for you into other programs when you press a special combination of keys on your keyboard. Note that although this feature is only available under Linux, other password safes like KeePass (on which KeePassX was based) support this feature on other operating systems, and it works similarly.</p><p>To enable this feature, do the following.</p><p> <i>1. Choose your global hotkey.</i> Choose “Settings” from the “Extras” menu, and then choose “Advanced” in the pane on the left. Click inside the “Global Auto-Type Shortcut” field, and then press the shortcut-key combination you wish to use. (For example, press and hold Ctrl, Alt, and Shift, and then hit “p.” You can use any key combination you like, but you’ll want to make sure that it doesn’t conflict with hotkeys other applications use, so try to stay away from things like Ctrl+X or Alt+F4.) Once you’re satisfied, click “OK.”</p><p> <i>2. Setup auto-type for a specific password.</i> Make sure that you have the window open where you’ll want to enter the password. Then go to KeePassX, find the entry for which you want to enable auto-type, and double-click on the entry’s title to open up the “New Entry” dialog.</p><p> <i>3.</i> Click the “Tools” button in the bottom left, and select “Auto-Type: Select target window.” In the dialog that pops up, expand the drop-down box and choose the title of the window in which you want the username and password to be entered. Click OK, and then click OK again.</p><p><i>Test it out!</i> Now in order to autotype your username and password, go to the window/website where you want KeePassX to autotype your username/password for you. Make sure your cursor is in the text box for your username, and then hit the combination of keys you chose above for the global hotkey. As long as KeePassX is open (even if it’s minimized or not focused) your username and password should automatically be entered.</p><p>Note that depending on how the website/window is set up, this feature may not work 100% correctly right off the bat. (It might enter the username but not the password, for example.) You can troubleshoot and customize this feature, though—for more information we recommend looking at the KeePass documentation <a href=\"http://keepass.info/help/base/autotype.html\">here</a>. (Although there are some differences between KeePass and KeePassX, that page should be enough to guide you in the right direction.)</p><p>It is recommended that you use a key combination that is difficult to hit accidentally. You don't want to accidentally paste your bank account password into a Facebook post!</p><h3>2.5 Other features</h3><p>You can search your database by typing something in the search box (the text box in the toolbar of the main KeePassX window) and hitting enter.</p><p>You can also sort your entries by clicking on the column header in the main window.</p><p>You can also “lock” KeePassX by choosing “File > Lock Workspace,” so that you can leave KeePassX open, but have it ask for your master password (and/or keyfile) before you can access your password database again. You can also have KeePassX automatically lock itself after a certain period of inactivity. This can prevent someone from accessing your passwords if you step away from your computer. To enable this feature, choose “Extras > Settings” from the menu and click on the security options. Then check the box that says “Lock database after inactivity of {number} seconds.”</p><p>KeePassX can also store more than just usernames and passwords. For example, you can create entries to store important things like account numbers, or product keys, or serial numbers, or anything else. There’s no requirement that the data you put in the “Password” field actually has to be a password. It can be anything you want—just input what you want to store in the “Password” field instead of an actual password (and leave the “Username” field blank if there’s no username) and KeePassX will safely and securely remember it for you.</p>"));

It works on pictures that you take with the ObscuraCam app itself, but you can also blur faces in other photos, as long as you have a way to copy or move the image files onto your Android device.</p><h3>2.1 Taking And Obscuring New Photos</h3><p>To take a photo on your Android device without showing your subjects' faces, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1:</b> From the main screen of ObscuraCam tap “New Picture”.</p><img src=\"tool_obscura2.png\"><p><b>Step 2:</b> Your phone's camera app will open, take a photo as you normally would.</p><p><b>Step 3:</b> A screen with a preview of the photo you took will be displayed. Tap the tick to proceed with obscuring the photo, otherwise tap the x to discard the current photo and take another.</p><p><b>Step 4:</b> ObscuraCam** will attempt to identify faces automatically.</p><p><b>Step 5:</b> If ObscuraCam can detect faces in the photo it will add an image \"tag\" (a rectangle used to select content that should be hidden) over the face and pixelate it. If ObscuraCam did not detect any faces or you need to obscure additional areas on the photo, tap on the area to add additional tags.</p><img src=\"tool_obscura3.png\"><p><b>Step 6:</b> To see a preview of the photo you can tap the eye icon, to return to the edit screen tap anywhere on the preview image.</p><p><b>Step 7:</b> To share the obscured photo via an existing application on your phone such as K-9 Mail or TextSecure tap the icon made up of a dot with arrows. </p><p><b>Step 8:</b> To save the blurred photo to your phone tap the save icon. You will be asked whether you want to delete the original, unblurred, image from your phone, if you no longer need the original photo tap “Yes” otherwise tap “No” to save a copy of both the obscured and unobscured photo.</p><h3>2.1.2 Obscuring Existing Photos</h3><p>As well as obscuring photos as you take them, ObscuraCam can also obscure any old photos on your phone or that you copy to your phone.</p><p><b>Step 1:</b> From the main screen of ObscuraCam tap “Obscure Photo”.</p><p><b>Step 2:</b> Browse to the file on your phone that you want to obscure.</p><p><b>Step 3:</b> ObscuraCam will attempt to detect any faces in the image and pixelate them.</p><p><b>Step 4:</b> If ObscuraCam did not detect any faces or you want to obscure additional faces or items in the photo tap the relevant area to add additional pixelation.</p><p><b>Step 5:</b> To see a preview of the photo you can tap the eye icon, to return to the edit screen tap anywhere on the preview image.</p><p><b>Step 6:</b> To share the obscured photo via an existing application on your phone such as K-9 Mail or TextSecure tap the icon made up of a dot with arrows. </p><p><b>Step 7:</b> To save the blurred photo to your phone tap the save icon. You will be asked whether you want to delete the original, unblurred, image from your phone, if you no longer need the original photo tap “Yes” otherwise tap “No” to save a copy of both the obscured and unobscured photo.</p><h3>2.3 Modifying the \"blur\" mode</h3><h3>2.3.1 Resize or move the tag</h3><p>While editing a photo in ObscuraCam, if you need to resize the tag, touch one of the four corners of the white outline box so that it turns green and drag it to make it larger or smaller.</p><p>If you need to move the tag so that it is in a better position on the photo, touch the centre of the pixelated area so that the surrounding white box turns green, then drag the box to the location you want.</p><img src=\"tool_obscura4.png\"><h3>2.3.2 Change the obscure type</h3><p>ObscuraCam gives you a few options on how to obscure a photo. From the edit screen tap on an existing obscured area to bring up the obscuring options:</p><img src=\"tool_obscura5.png\"><p><b>Pixelate</b> will obscure any part of the photo inside the tag by pixelating it</p><img src=\"tool_obscura6.png\"><p><b>Redact</b> will obscure any part of the photo inside the tag by placing a black box over it</p><img src=\"tool_obscura7.png\"><p><b>Mask</b> will obscure any part of the photo inside the tag by placing a funny mask over the person</p><img src=\"tool_obscura8.png\"><p><b>Crowd Pixel</b> will obscure any part of the photo <i>outside</i> the tag by pixelating the rest of it.</p><img src=\"tool_obscura9.png\"><p><b>Clear Tag</b> will remove the selected tag from the photo.</p><h3>2.3 Obscuring Videos</h3><p>Obscuracam can also obscure faces or objects in videos, however unlike with photos it can only obscure existing photos that you took with your phone or copied to your phone</p><h3>2.3.1 Automatic Obscuring of Videos</h3><p><b>Step 1:</b> From the main screen of Obscuracam tap “Obscure Video”.</p><p><b>Step 2:</b> Select the video you with to obscure from your phones storage</p><p><b>Step 3:</b> Tap “Yes” when asked <i>Would you like to detect faces in this video</i>.</p><p><b>Step 3:</b> The video will begin to play and ObscuraCam will attempt to detect faces. The process for detecting faces takes approximately <i>4 seconds</i> for every <i>1 second</i> of the video.</p><p><b>Step 4:</b> Once the face detection has completed, you can tap Play to review the video. This will show you the pixelated tags over the faces as well as a green trail showing the path the tag takes through the video as the face moves.</p><img src=\"tool_obscura10.png\"><p><b>Step 5:</b> After reviewing the video and you are happy that all faces are obscured, tap the save icon at the top of the screen to save the video to your phones storage.</p><img src=\"tool_obscura11.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> If ObscuraCam did not properly obscure faces or failed to detect some, you can see how to manually obscure them in section below.</p><h3>2.3.2 Manual Obscuring of Videos</h3><p>If ObscuraCam was not able to detect faces properly during the automatic process or you would like more process over the obscuring process you can manually obscure video.</p><p><b>Step 1:</b> From the main screen of Obscuracam tap “Obscure Video”.</p><p><b>Step 2:</b> Select the video you with to obscure from your phones storage.</p><p><b>Step 3:</b> Tap “No” when asked <i>Would you like to detect faces in this video</i>.</p><p><b>Step 4:</b> Tap the play icon to start playing the video</p><p><b>Step 5:</b> While the video plays, touch and hold your finger on a face in the video to add a tag over it, drag the tag around the screen with your finger following the movement of the face. Lift your finger off the screen to stop obscuring the video.</p><p><b>Note:</b> As you follow the face on the screen you will see a green trail being left behind, this is the path the pixelated tag will take once the video is saved.</p><p><b>Step 6:</b> If there are additional faces in the video that you wish to obscure, touch and hold the blue circle and move the slider back to the time point where the next face appears on video and repeat <i>step 5</i> above.</p><p><b>Step 7:</b> Once you have finished manually obscuring faces, you can tap the play icon to review the video. This will show you the pixelated tags over the faces as well as a green trail showing the path the tag takes through the video as the face moves.</p><p><b>Step 8:</b> After reviewing the video and you are happy that all faces are obscured, tap the save icon at the top of the screen to save the video to your phones storage.</p><h3>2.3.3 Changing Output Video Quality</h3><p>ObscuraCam chooses a default video quality when saving that make the video small enough to easily share via email or other methods but does reduce resolution and quality of the video.</p><p>To keep the obscured video in a higher resolution:</p><p><b>Step 1:</b> After either automatically or manually detecting faces and before saving the video, tap the three vertical dots icon to bring up the menu and select “Preferences”.</p><p><b>Step 2:</b> Review and change the settings you want, where possibly ObscuraCam will give you the range by which each setting can be changed.</p><img src=\"tool_obscura12.png\"><p><b> Step 3:</b> Once you have made the desired output changes, tap the back button on your phone and save the video.</p>"));

Both of these are important defenses if you're being targeted for surveillance or misinformation.</p><h3>1.0 Before you start </h3><p>To use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), you will need to install some extra software that will work with your current email program. You will also need to create a private key, which you will keep private. The private key is what you will use to decrypt emails sent to you, and to digitally sign emails that you send to show they truly came from you. Finally, you'll learn how to distribute your public key—a small chunk of information that others will need to know before they can send you encrypted mail, and that they can use to verify emails you send.</p><p>This guide will show you how to use PGP with a Linux-style operating system using Mozilla Thunderbird, a popular open source graphical email client.</p><p>You can't currently use PGP directly with a web email service like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, or Outlook Live. You can still use your webmail address; you’ll just have to configure it with the Thunderbird program on your computer.</p><p><b>Note that both ends of the email conversation need to be using PGP-compatible software for it to work.</b></p><p>People will normally use this only on their own personal devices, not on shared devices. Fortunately, PGP is available for most desktop computers and mobile devices, and you can point them to these guides to help them set up their own version.</p><h3>2.0 Installing Thunderbird, GnuPG and Enigmail </h3><p>PGP is an open standard, which means that more than one piece of software can use it. The software we're going to use for PGP is called GnuPG. We'll also be adding a plug-in to Thunderbird called Enigmail, which lets you use GnuPGP from within Thunderbird. The following instructions require some comfort with the command line.</p><p>If you're using using a Red Hat-based distribution such as Red Hat or Fedora Core, open a terminal and run these commands:</p><p><i>sudo yum install gnupg thunderbird thunderbird-enigmail</i></p><p>If you are using a Ubuntu-based distribution such as Ubuntu, or Linux Mint, open a terminal and type these commands to make sure you have the right software installed:</p><p><i>sudo apt-get install gnupg thunderbird enigmail</i></p><p>If you're using the Debian distribution, you'll find that Thunderbird is called “Icedove.” Like Debian in general, this is for entirely reasonable but somewhat obscure reasons. Apart from the name, it's exactly the same program: we'll not mention Icedove again, but you can just replace “Thunderbird” with Icedove in the rest of this guide, and everything should still work.</p><p>Use this command in the Terminal to install it:</p><p><i>sudo apt-get install gnupg icedove enigmail</i></p><h3>2.1 Configuring Thunderbird</h3><p>Now that you've installed Thunderbird, open it as you would another application on your machine (you might pick it from a list of applications on a menu, or type its name into an application search). You will see the first run wizard appear.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin1.png\"><p>To set up your existing email address, click \"Skip this and use my existing email,” and then enter your name, email address, and the password to your email account.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin2.png\"><p>If you use a popular free email service like Gmail, Thunderbird should be able to automatically detect your email settings when you click “Continue.”</p><p><b>If you use two-factor authentication with Google (and depending on your threat model you probably should!) you cannot use your standard Gmail password with Thunderbird. Instead, you will need to create a new application-specific password for Thunderbird to access your Gmail account. See <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1173270?hl=en\">Google's own guide</a> for doing this.</b></p><img src=\"tool_pgplin3.png\"><p>If it doesn't, you may need to manually configure your IMAP and SMTP settings. If you don’t know how to do this, talk to your email provider, or ask someone technical who is familiar with your email provider (so, an IT person at work, or a technical friend who uses the same ISP as you; they don't need to know how to use PGP, but you can ask them “Do you know the IMAP and SMTP settings for my email address?”).</p><h3>2.2 Configuring Enigmail</h3><p>Enigmail is a plugin for Thunderbird that encrypts and decrypts PGP-encoded emails, and makes handling private and public keys a little easier. If you have the latest version of Enigmail, you should be presented with the Enigmail Setup Wizard.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin4.png\"><p>If you don't see it, you can use this menu option from Thunderbird to make it appear. Click on the three horizontal lines (the “hamburger menu”) on the right of the Thunderbird window.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin5.png\"><p>Here's the first option that Enigmail offers you: three options for handling when to encrypt your mail.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin6.png\"><p>The default option is to encrypt emails if you have the “public key” of another person, Enigmail will encrypt the email you send but leave emails unencrypted if you don't have the public key of the recipient yet. You also have the option to encrypt emails all the time to everyone with PGP keys, which means that you will have to find the public keys for people for whom you don't have them already, or turn off automatic encryption completely and only use PGP when directed.</p><p>We don't know what the appropriate option is for you, but believe the “Convenient auto encryption” option to be a good choice. If you are in doubt, choose “Don't encrypt my messages by default.” </p><p>Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin6.png\"><p>Now you have an option to digitally sign all outgoing emails. Signing your email with PGP allows the recipient to check that you sent the message, and that the contents of the message were not tampered with. Click the “Sign my messages by default” button to turn this feature on. </p><p>The downside of doing this, however, is that it can also flag to anyone you send mail to that you use PGP. <a href=\"www.cryptolaw.org/\">In some parts of the world</a> (including China, Iran, Belarus, and some Middle-East states) using unlicensed encryption, even for personal use, is illegal, so you might have very good reasons to not let others know you use PGP.</p><p>Click the “Next” Button.</p><p>Now you'll see an option to have Enigmail make some changes to the configuration of Mozilla Thunderbird.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin7.png\"><p>If you click the Details button you can review what those changes are.</p><p>The following options can be unchecked (reenabled), for a more seamless transition, if you use PGP/Mime by default (we'll set that later):<br>• Disable flowed text<br>• View message body as plain text<br>• Do not compose HTML messages</p><p>The final option prevents potential problems in the encryption and decryption of your email. Be aware that selecting this box will remove the ability to send text that is bolded, underlined or colored. After reviewing the changes, click the “OK button.”</p><p>Now you will start creating your private key and public key.</p><h3>2.3 Creating a public key and private key</h3><p>Installation and setup of the Enigmail add-on is complete. Now you'll have the option of creating your public and private key pair. This assumes you have not created a private key before.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin8.png\"><p>Click the “Next” button.</p><p>Unless you have already configured more than one email account, Enigmail will choose the email account you've already configured. The first thing you'll need to do is come up with a strong passphrase for your private key. See the <b><a href=\"umbrella://lesson/passwords\">Passwords lesson</a></b> for more information on how to do this.</p><p>Enigmail will display some information about your private key as well as the configuration settings. We recommend creating 4096-bit length keys. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin9.png\"><p><b>Your key will expire at a certain time; when that happens, other people will stop using it entirely for new emails to you, though you might not get any warning or explanation about why. So, you may want to mark your calendar and pay attention to this issue a month or so before the expiration date.</b></p><p>It's possible to extend the lifetime of an existing key by giving it a new, later expiration date, or it's possible to replace it with a new key by creating a fresh one from scratch. Both processes might require contacting people who email you and making sure that they get the updated key; current software isn't very good at automating this. So make a reminder for yourself; if you don't think you'll be able to manage it, you can consider setting the key so that it never expires, though in that case other people might try to use it when contacting you far in the future even if you no longer have the private key or no longer use PGP.</p><p>Enigmail will generate the key and when it is complete, a small window will open asking you to generate a revocation certificate. This revocation certificate is important to have as it allows you to make the private key and public key invalid. It is important to note that merely deleting the private key does not invalidate the public key and may lead to people sending you encrypted mail that you can't decrypt.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin10.png\"><p>Click the “Generate Certificate” button.</p><p>A window will open to provide you a place to save the revocation certificate. While you can save the file to your computer, we recommend saving the file on a USB drive that you are using for nothing else and storing the drive in a safe spot. We also recommend removing the revocation certificate from the computer with the keys, just to avoid unintentional revocation.</p><p>Even better, save this file on a separate encrypted disk. Choose the location where you are saving this file and click the “Save” button.</p><p>Now Enigmail will give you further information about saving the revocation certificate file again. Click the “OK” button.</p><p>Finally, you are done with generating the private key and public key. Click the “Finish” button.</p><h3>2.4 Optional steps</h3><h3>2.4.1 Display long key-IDs</h3><p>The next steps are completely optional but they can be helpful when using OpenPGP and Enigmail. Briefly, the Key ID is a small part of the fingerprint. When it comes to verifying that a public key belongs to a particular person the fingerprint is the best way. Changing the default display makes it easier to read the fingerprints of the certificates you know about. Click the configuration button, then the Enigmail option, then Key Management.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin11.png\"><p>A window will open showing two columns: Name and Key ID.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin12.png\"><p>On the far right there is a small button. Click that button to configure the columns. Unclick the Key ID option and click the Fingerprint option.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin13.png\"><p>Now change the width of the Fingerprint column by moving the mouse to the lines between each column heading (that is, just to the left of the “Key ID” header at the top of the list of keys), and dragging the line to the left. Keep moving left until you can see all of the Key ID, like this:</p><p>Now the columns will look like this:</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin14.png\"><p>Now you are set up to send and receive regular and encrypted email. Next you will go through the steps of actually finding the people to exchange encrypted mail with.</p><p><b>Using PGP doesn't completely encrypt your email so that the sender and receiver information is encrypted. Encrypting the sender and receiver information would break email. Using Thunderbird with the Enigmail add-on gives you an easy way to encrypt and decrypt the content of your email.</b></p><h3>3.0 Letting others know you are using PGP</h3><p><b>a) Let people know you are using PGP with an email</b></p><p>You can easily email your public key to another person by sending them a copy as an attachment.</p><p>Click the “Write” button in Mozilla Thunderbird.</p><p>Fill in an address and a subject, perhaps something like “my public key,” click the Enigmail menu and select the “Attach My Public Key” option.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin15.png\"><p>You can now the email and the recipient will be able to download and use the public key you sent.</p><p><b>If this method is used, it's a good idea to have the recipient verify your public key's fingerprint over some other form of communication, in case email is already being intercepted and tampered with.</b></p><p><b>b) Let people know you are using PGP on your website</b></p><p>In addition to letting people know via email, you can post your public key on your website. The easiest way is to upload the file and link to it. This guide won't go into how to do those things, but you should know how to export the certificate as a file to use in the future.</p><p>Click the configuration button, then the Enigmail option, then Key Management.</p><p>Highlight your certificate in bold, then right-click to bring up the menu and select Export keys to file.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin16.png\"><p>A small window will pop up with three buttons. Click the “Export Public Keys Only” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin17.png\"></p><p><b>Make sure you don't click the “Export Secret Keys” button because exporting the secret key could allow others to impersonate you if they are able to guess your password.</b></p><p>Now a window will open so you can save the file. In order to make it easier to find in the future please save the file to the Documents folder.</p><p>Now you can use this file as you wish.</p><p><b>c) Uploading to a keyserver</b></p><p>Keyservers make it easier to search for and download public keys. Most modern keyservers are synchronizing, meaning that a public key uploaded to one server will eventually reach all servers.</p><p>Although uploading your public key to a keyserver might be a convenient way of letting people know that you have a public PGP certificate, you should know that due to the nature of how keyservers work, there is no way to delete public keys once they are uploaded, you can only mark them as revoked.</p><p><b>Before uploading your public key to a keyserver, it is good to take a moment to consider whether you want the whole world to know that you have a public key without the ability to remove this information at a later time.</b></p><p>If you choose to upload your public key to keyservers, you will go back to the Enigmail Key Management window.</p><p>Click the Keyserver menu item and select the Upload Public Keys option.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin18.png\"><h3>3.1 Finding other people who are using PGP</h3><p><b>a) Getting a public key by email</b></p><p>You might get a public key sent to you as an email attachment.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin19.png\"><p>Notice the attachment at the bottom of the window. Right-click on the attachment and select “Import OpenPGP Key.” A small window will open giving you the results of the import. Click the OK button.</p><p>If you open up the Enigmail key management window again, you can check the result. Your PGP key is in bold because you have both the private key and the public key. The public key you just imported is not bold because it doesn't contain the private key.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin20.png\"><p><b>b) Getting a public key as a file</b></p><p>It's possible that you get a public key by downloading it from a website or someone might have sent it through chat software. In a case like this, you will assume you downloaded the file to the Downloads folder.</p><p>Open the Enigmail Key Manager and click on the “File” menu. Select “Import Keys from File.”</p><p>The public key might have very different file name endings such as .asc, .pgp, or .gpg. Select the file and click the “Open” button. A small window will open, giving you the results of the import. Click the “OK” button.</p><p><b>c) Getting a public key from a key server</b></p><p>Keyservers can be a very useful way of getting public keys. Try looking for a public key. Open up the key manager then click the “Keyserver” menu and select “Search for Keys.”</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin21.png\"><p>A small window will pop up with a search field. You can search by a complete email address, a partial email address, or a name. In this case, you will search for certificates containing “eff.org.”</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin22.png\"><p>A larger window will pop up with many options. If you scroll down you'll notice some certificates are italicized and grayed out. These are certificates that have either been revoked or expired on their own.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin23.png\"><p>Let's take the public keys of Danny O'Brien for example, he has one expired or revoked certificate and one valid certificate. Select the valid certificate by clicking the box on the left then press the OK button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin24.png\"><p>In some cases a person may have more than one certificate, all appearing valid. Note that it's possible for anyone to upload a public certificate for anyone else, and that one of these keys may not belong to the person that owns the email address associated with it. In this case, verifying the fingerprint is extremely important.</p><p>A small notification window will pop up letting you know if you succeeded, and the Enigmail Key Manager will now show you the added certificates:</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin25.png\"><h3>4.0 Sending PGP encrypted mail</h3><p>Now you will send your first encrypted email to a recipient. In the main Mozilla Thunderbird window click the “Write” button. A new window will open.</p><p>Write your message, and enter a recipient. For this test, select a recipient whose public key you already have. Enigmail will detect this and automatically encrypt the email (you can tell it will be encrypted by the golden key at the bottom right of the email).</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin26.png\"><p><b>Note that the subject line won't be encrypted, so choose something innocuous, like “hello.”</b></p><p>When you click the “Send” button, you'll be given a window to enter the password to your PGP Key. Remember this is different from your email password!</p><p>Enter your password then click the “OK” button and your email will be encrypted and sent.</p><p>The body of the email was encrypted and transformed. For example our text above, was converted to this:</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin27.png\"><h3>4.1 Receiving PGP encrypted mail</h3><p>Let's go through what happens when you receive encrypted email. First, click on the message.</p><p>A small window opens asking you for the password to the PGP key. Remember: Don't enter your email password. Click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin28.png\"><p>Now the message will show up decrypted</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin29.png\"><h3>5.0 Revoking the PGP Key</h3><p><b>a) Revoking your PGP Key through the Enigmail interface</b></p><p>The PGP keys generated by Enigmail automatically expire after five years. So if you lose all your files, you can hope that people will know to ask you for another key once the key has expired.</p><p>You might have a good reason to disable the PGP key before it expires. Perhaps you want to generate a new, stronger PGP key. The easiest way to revoke your own PGP key in Enigmail is through the Enigmail Key Manager. Right-click on your PGP key (it's in bold), and select the “Revoke Key” option.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin30.png\"><p>A window will pop up letting you know what happens and asking for your confirmation. Click the “Revoke Key” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin31.png\"><p>The password window opens, enter your password for the PGP key and click the “OK” button.</p><p>Now a new window will open up letting you know you succeeded. Click the “OK” button.</p><p>When you go back to the Enigmail Key Management window you'll notice a change to your PGP key. It is now grayed out and italicized.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin32.png\"><p><b>b) Revoking a PGP Key with a revocation certificate</b></p><p>As mentioned before, the PGP keys generated by Enigmail automatically expire after five years. So if you lose all your files you can be sure that people will know to ask you for another key once the key has expired.</p><p>Like we mentioned before, you might have a good reason to disable the PGP key before it expires.</p><p>Similarly, others might have good reasons to revoke an existing key.</p><p>You might get sent revocation certificates from friends as a notice that they want to revoke their key.</p><p>In the previous section you might have noticed that Enigmail generates and imports a revocation certificate internally when you use the Enigmail Key Manager to revoke a key. Since you already have a revocation certificate, you will use the one you generated earlier to revoke your own key.</p><p>Start with the Enigmail Key Manager and click the “File” menu and select “Import Keys from File.”</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin33.png\"><p>A window will open up so you can select the revocation certificate. Click on the file, and click the “Open” button. You'll get a notification that the certificate was imported successfully and that a key was revoked. Click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin34.png\"><p>Once you click the “OK” button, you'll be taken back to the Enigmail Key Manager and you see the certificate you revoked greyed out and italicized.</p><img src=\"tool_pgplin35.png\"><p>If the key you revoked is your own, and you previously uploaded your public key to the key servers, you will want to re-upload the now-revoked key to the key servers, so that others see not to use it anymore.</p><p>Now that you have all the proper tools, try sending your own PGP-encrypted email.</p>"));

Both of these are important defenses if you're being targeted for surveillance or misinformation.</p><h3>1.0 Before you start </h3><p>To use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), you will need to install some extra software that will work with your current email program. You will also need to create a private key, which you will keep private. The private key is what you will use to decrypt emails sent to you, and to digitally sign emails that you send to show they truly came from you. Finally, you'll learn how to distribute your public key—a small chunk of information that others will need to know before they can send you encrypted mail, and that they can use to verify emails you send.</p><p>This guide will show you how to use PGP with an Apple Mac (but not iPad or iPhone), with either the Mac's built-in Mail program, or with Mozilla Thunderbird, a popular alternative email program.</p><p>You can't currently use PGP directly with a web email service like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, or Outlook Live. You can still use your webmail address; you’ll just have to configure it with the Thunderbird program on your computer.</p><p><b>Note that both ends of the email conversation need to be using PGP-compatible software for it to work.</b></p><p>People will normally use this only on their own personal devices, not on shared devices. Fortunately, PGP is available for most desktop computers and mobile devices, and you can point them to these guides to help them set up their own version. This guide is for Mac users.</p><h3>2.0 Installing GPGTools on your Mac </h3><p>PGP is an open standard, which means that more than one piece of software can use it. The software we're going to use for PGP is called the GPG Suite, from GPG Tools, because it works on Macs, is free for anyone to use, and it's open source: the underlying source code is available for anyone to check for bugs and backdoors.</p><p>Once the GPG Suite is installed, you can set up your keys for the first time, and then enable PGP on Apple Mail and, optionally, Thunderbird.</p><p><b>Step 1: Install the program.</b></p><p>First, go to <a href=\"https://www.gpgtools.org/\">https://www.gpgtools.org/</a> in your browser and choose “Download GPG Suite.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx1.png\"><p>You'll end up with a disk image that you can click on to install the software. If you're not accustomed to installing third-party software on your computer, ask a nearby Mac expert – this is a step most techies can help you with, even if they don't know PGP or encryption.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx2.png\"><p>Clicking on install will give you a list of tools that will be added to your computer.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx3.png\"><p><b><i>What exactly am I installing here?</i></b></p><p>These are tools will mostly work behind the scenes so that more than one program on your Mac can use PGP. Think of them as programs that other programs can use, rather than applications that you will use directly. GPGMail lets Apple Mail send and read PGP emails, GPG Keychain Access lets you keep your private and public keys in the same manner as you can save other passwords on your Mac.</p><p>GPGServices optionally adds a feature to OS X to let you use PGP directly in programs other than email (for instance, in a word processor). GPGPreferences is for changing PGP settings in Apple's preferences. Finally, MacGPG2 is the basic tool that any program needs to use to do encryption or signing.</p></p>In October 2014, the GPG Tools team announced that they would soon be charging for GPGMail, the part of their package that lets you use GPG with Apple's Mail application. This tutorial is about using GPG with Thunderbird, so it doesn't use that component. You can just use the zero-cost part of the GPG Suite, as outlined here, if you like. This option has the added benefit that all of these tools are \"free software\" meaning you are still allowed to freely examine, edit and redistribute GPG Mail's underlying source code, so they are even more secure. For more information, see GPG Tools' <a href=\"https://gpgtools.org/news.html\">own FAQ</a> on their decision. </p><p>Click \"Continue\" to install GPG Suite.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx4.png\"><p>When the installation is complete, open GPG Keychain (found in your applications folder) if it doesn't automatically open and prompt you to generate your PGP keys after installation.  Click \"New\" to generate your PGP keys.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx5.png\"><p><b>Step 2: Create your PGP key</b></p><p>Sometimes when you install new software, your computer will pester you with questions that have no obvious answer, without actually giving you any advice on how to reply. This is one of those times.</p><p>It's important to spend a little time thinking about the answers you'll give here, because changing your PGP key details can be difficult later, and if you’ve chosen to publish your key somewhere, you won’t be able to unpublish it. (There are still thousands of old public keys from the 1990’s floating around, with the names and old email addresses of the people who made them back then.)</p><p>PGP keys contain a name and an email address that link the key to you. The email address will be one of the ways others can discover which key to use when they are encrypting a message to you.</p><p><b><i>When should I not put my real name or email address on my PGP key? When shouldn't I upload my key?</i></b></p><p>For most people, it makes sense to add a real email address to your key, and upload it to the public keyservers – it's how people will match the right key to you. They can send you an email directly, and know it will be encrypted with the right key, and when they receive a signed email from you, the digital signature will be marked with your name.</p><p>For some people, though, it will not make sense to add your real name to your key, for instance if your threat model means that having your identity publicly attached to your key (and the linked email address) is not a good idea. Edward Snowden communicated with journalists using PGP and an anonymous email address before he revealed his identity; his PGP key certainly wasn't marked with his name.</p><p><b>Uploading your key is normal practice, but it can reveal that you're using encryption, even if you don't use your own name. Also, as we'll see, others might upload your key and associate their own key with it, implying that you and they have a connection. That can be harmful if you are communicating and don't want people to know it. It can also be troublesome if you're not communicating, but your attacker wants people to think that you are associated.</b></p><p>Here's a rough guideline: if you're thinking about using a pseudonym generally, use that pseudonym (and alternative email) when labeling your key. If you are in a more dangerous environment, when you don't want people to know you're using PGP at all, or know who you are communicating with, don't upload your key to the public keyservers – and make sure the small group of people you're communicating with know not to upload your key either. There are other ways of verifying keys that don't rely on them being available on the public key server – see EFF’s guide to <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/key-verification#overlay=en/node/37/\">Key Verification</a> for more information.</p><p>Click the \"Upload public key after generation\" box if you'd like to let others find your key quickly so that they can send you encrypted messages. It's like adding your phone number to a public phone directory: you don't need it, but it's convenient for others.</p><p>Before generating the key, expand \"Advanced options.\" You can leave the comment blank, and leave the key type \"RSA and RSA (default).\" But make sure to change the Length field to 4096.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx6.png\"><p><b>Your key will expire at a certain time; when that happens, other people will stop using it entirely for new emails to you, though you might not get any warning or explanation about why. So, you may want to mark your calendar and pay attention to this issue a month or so before the expiration date.</b></p><p>It's possible to extend the lifetime of an existing key by giving it a new, later expiration date, or it's possible to replace it with a new key by creating a fresh one from scratch. Both processes might require contacting people who email you and making sure that they get the updated key; current software isn't very good at automating this. So make a reminder for yourself; if you don't think you'll be able to manage it, you can consider setting the key so that it never expires, though in that case other people might try to use it when contacting you far in the future even if you no longer have the private key or no longer use PGP.</p><p>When you're ready, click the \"Generate key\" button.</p><p>You computer will start generating both your public and private key. It shouldn't take any more than a couple of minutes to finish (it takes a while because to create your keys, your computer needs to gather random numbers. Think of it as your computer throwing a pair of dice many, many, many times.)</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx7.png\"><p>When you're done generating your key, you'll see it key listed in GPG Keychain Access. You can double-click on your key to see information about it, including its \"fingerprint ”—a unique way to identify your PGP key.</p><p>Now is a good time to generate a revocation certificate. (A revocation certificate is a file that you can generate that announces that you no longer trust that key. You generate it when you still have the secret key, and keep it for any future disaster.) In the future, if you ever worry that your private key has been copied by someone, you accidentally delete or lose your private key, or you forget your passphrase, you can tell everyone it has been revoked, or cancelled, by using a revocation certificate. </p><p>It's better to create one now, because you need the private key and passphrase to create a revocation certificate. If you leave it until later, you might lose one or the other, and then it will be too late. So create a certificate by clicking on your key, choosing the “Key” menu entry, and then “Create Revocation Certificate.” You'll be prompted for somewhere to save the file. You might want to keep it with a backup copy of the key (see next step).</p><p><b>Step 3: Back up your PGP key</b></p><p>If you lose access to your private key, you won't be able to decrypt any incoming PGP mail, or your old mail. On the other hand, you want to keep your private key as securely as you can.</p><p>You might want to save a backup copy to a USB key, which you keep safely hidden. You will only need it if you lose your original key, but for safety you will want to keep it out of the hands of your potential attackers.</p><p><b><i>Is everything lost if my attackers get hold of my PGP private key?</i></b></p></p>What if you get your Mac stolen, or your backup key is taken from you? Does that mean your PGP messages are vulnerable? No: if you've chosen a good passphrase and nobody has been able to learn what it is, you should still be mostly protected. To be safe, you may want to revoke your old key, and create a new PGP key. This won’t stop your old key from being able to decrypt your old email, but it will discourage other people from using the old key for their new emails to you.</p><p>To backup your key, open GPG Keychain Access. Select your key, and click “Export” in the toolbar. Put your USB drive into the machine, and choose it in the “Where” part of the “Save As...” dialog. Check the “Allow secret key export” checkbox.</p><p><b>OPTION A) Configuring Apple Mail</b></p><p>When you first open Apple Mail, you'll see a first run wizard that helps you set up your email address. Fill out your name, email address, and your email password and click \"Create.\"</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx8.png\"><p><b>Mail account setup wizard</b></p><p>If you use popular free email services like Gmail, Mail should be able to automatically detect your email settings when you click Continue. If it doesn't, you may need to manually configure your IMAP and SMTP settings. Talk to the company you use for email, or ask someone technical who is familiar with your email provider (so, an IT person at work, or a technical friend who uses the same ISP as you. They don't need to know about PGP, but you can ask them “Can you set up Apple Mail for me?”).</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx9.png\"><p><b>Mail account setup auto-detect</p></p><p>When you're composing a new message, there are two icons just beneath the Subject field. There's a padlock (encrypt email) and a star (digitally sign email). If the padlock is closed it means this email will be encrypted, and if the star has a check in it, it means this email will be digitally signed.</p><p><b>Sending PGP Signed or Encrypted Email</b></p><img src=\"tool_pgposx10.png\"><p>You can always sign your email, even if the recipient doesn’t use PGP. Because digitally signing emails requires your secret key, Mail will pop up a window asking for your passphrase when you first sign an email.</p><p>You can only encrypt emails if the person you’re emailing uses PGP and you have that person’s public key. If the encryption padlock icon is unlocked and greyed out so you can't click on it, this means you first need to import the recipient's public key. Either ask them to send it to you, or use the GPG Keychain Access app to find the key to from a public keyserver.</p><p>To be absolutely safe, you'll need to verify the keys you get from the keyserver or your colleague. See EFF’s guide to <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/key-verification#overlay=en/node/37/\">Key Verification</a> for more information.</p><p><b>OPTION B) Using PGP with Mozilla Thunderbird</b></p><p>This walkthrough shows how to use GPG with the free, open source, Thunderbird mail client from Mozilla, together with the Enigmail plugin for email encryption.</p><p>First, download Thunderbird from <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird\">https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird</a>, mount the disk image as you did with GPG Tools, and drag the Thunderbird into Applications. When you open it for the first time it will ask if you want to set it as your default email client. Go ahead and click \"Set as Default.”</p><img src=\"tool_pxposx11.png\"><p>Then you will see the first run wizard. To set up your existing email address, click \"Skip this and use my existing email.\" Then enter your name, email address, and the password to your email account.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx12.png\"><p>If you use popular free email services like Gmail, Thunderbird should be able to automatically detect your email settings when you click Continue. If it doesn't, you may need to manually configure your IMAP and SMTP settings—ask your ISP, or a technical friend who knows about setting up email, to help. Sometimes, Thunderbird can just guess the correct settings.</p><p><b>If you use two-factor authentication with Google (and depending on your threat model you probably should!) you cannot use your standard Gmail password with Thunderbird. Instead, you will need to create a new application-specific password for Thunderbird to access your Gmail account. See <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1173270?hl=en\">Google's own guide</a> for doing this. </b></p><img src=\"tool_pgposx13.png\"><p>After you're done configuring Thunderbird to check your email, click \"Done.\" Then click on \"Inbox\" in the top left to load your emails.</p><p>Now that you've installed and configured Thunderbird to work with your email, you need to install <a href=\"https://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php\">Enigmail</a>, the GPG add-on for Thunderbird. In Thunderbird, click the menu icon in the top-right, and choose Add-ons.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx14.png\"><p>Search for \"enigmail\" in the search box in the top right.</p><img src=\"tooL_pgposx15.png\"><p>Click the Install button next to the Enigmail extension to download and install Enigmail. When it's done, click \"Restart Now\" to restart Thunderbird.</p><p>The first time you run Thunderbird with Enigmail enabled it opens the OpenPGP Setup Wizard. Click \"Cancel.\" We will manually configure Enigmail instead.</p><p>Click the menu button, hover over Preferences, and choose Account Settings.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx16.png\"><p>Go to the OpenPGP Security tab. Make sure \"Enable OpenPGP support (Enigmail) for this identity\" is checked. \"Use specific OpenPGP key ID\" should be selected, and if your key isn't already selected you can click \"Select Key\" to select it.</p><p>You should also check \"Sign non-encrypted message by default,\" \"Sign encrypted messages by default,\" and \"Use PGP/MIME by default,\" but not (for most people) \"Encrypt messages by default.\"</p><p>If most of the people that you email use PGP (or you would like to encourage them to do so), you may wish to encrypt by default. It would be ideal to encrypt all the emails you send, but that is not always possible. Remember that you can only send encrypted email to other people who use PGP, and you need to have their public keys in your keychain. For most people, manually choosing to encrypt each email you send will probably work best.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx17.png\"><p>Then click \"OK\" to save all of the settings.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have Thunderbird and Enigmail set up! Here are a couple of quick pointers:</p><p>• You can click the menu button, hover over OpenPGP, and open Key Management to see the PGP key manager that's build-in to Enigmail. It's very similar to GPG Keychain Access, and it's your choice which you use.<br>• When you're composing a new message, there are two icons in the bottom right corner of the window: a pen (digitally sign email) and a key (encrypt email). If the icons are gold it means they are selected, and if they're silver it means they're not selected. Click on them to toggle signing and encrypting the email you're writing.</p><img src=\"tool_pgposx18.png\">"));

Both of these are important defenses if you're being targeted for surveillance or misinformation.</p><h3>1.0 Before you start </h3><p>To use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), you will need to install some extra software that will work with your current email program. You will also need to create a private key, which you will keep private. The private key is what you will use to decrypt emails sent to you, and to digitally sign emails that you send to show they truly came from you. Finally, you'll learn how to distribute your public key—a small chunk of information that others will need to know before they can send you encrypted mail, and that they can use to verify emails you send.</p><p><b>Note that both ends of the email conversation need to be using PGP-compatible software for it to work.</b></p><p>People will normally use this only on their own personal devices, not on shared devices. Fortunately, PGP is available for most desktop computers and mobile devices, and you can point them to these guides to help them set up their own version. This guide is for Windows users.</p><h3>1.1 Overview</h3><p>To use PGP to exchange secure emails you have to bring together three programs: GPG4Win (GNU Privacy Guard for Windows known as GnuPG), Mozilla Thunderbird and Enigmail. </p><p>• GnuPG is the program that actually encrypts and decrypts the content of your mail.<br>• Mozilla Thunderbird is an email client that allows you to read and write emails without using a browser.<br>• Enigmail is an add-on to Mozilla Thunderbird that ties it all together.</p><p>Note! What this guide teaches is how to use PGP with Mozilla Thunderbird, an email client program that performs a similar function to Outlook. You may have your own favorite email software program (or use a web mail service like Google Mail or Outlook.com). This guide won't tell you how to use PGP with these programs. You can choose either to install Thunderbird and experiment with PGP with a new email client, or you can investigate other solutions to use PGP with your customary software. We have still not found a satisfactory solution for these other programs.</p><p><b>Using PGP doesn't completely encrypt your email: the sender and receiver information is still unencrypted and so is the subject line!</b></p><p>Encrypting the sender and receiver information isn’t possible in the existing email system. What using Mozilla Thunderbird with the Enigmail add-on gives you is an easy way to encrypt the content of your email. Someone spying on your emails may still see the identities of the people you communicate with and when you email them.</p><p>You will first download all the software needed, install it, and then end with configuration and usage.</p><h3>2 Downloading the software</h3><h3>2.1 Getting GPG4Win</h3><p>You can get GnuPG (also known as GPG) on Windows by downloading the small installer from the GPG4Win download page.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin1.png\"><p>Click on the most recent version of GPG4Win with GnuPG component only (Vanilla or Light) to download the GPG installer.</p><p><b>Note: This version of GPG is available only on a web site that offers “http” downloads, not secure “https” downloads. If you are concerned that you may be targeted for surveillance by an organization that can tamper with your Internet connection, you may want to investigate more drastic solutions, such as downloading and running Tails, a secure operating system that replaces Windows.</b></p><p>Many browsers will ask you to confirm whether you want to download this file. Internet Explorer 11 shows a bar at the bottom of the browser window with an orange border.</p><p>For any browser it is best to first save the file before proceeding, so <i>click the “Save” button</i>. By default, most browsers save downloaded files in the Downloads folder.</p><h3>2.2 Getting Mozilla Thunderbird</h3><p>Go to the Mozilla Thunderbird website.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin2.png\"><p>Click on the green button labelled “Thunderbird Free Download.”</p><p>The Mozilla Thunderbird website will have detected your preferred language. If you want to use Thunderbird in another language click on the “Other Systems & Languages” link and make your selection from there.</p><p>Many browsers will ask you to confirm if you want to download this file. Internet Explorer 11 shows a bar at the bottom of the browser window with an orange border.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin3.png\"><p>For any browser, it is best to first save the file before proceeding, so click the “Save” button. By default, most browsers save downloaded files in the Downloads folder.</p><h3>2.3 Getting Enigmail</h3><p>You can get Enigmail from the Enigmail website.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin4.png\"><p>Many browsers will ask you to confirm if you want to download this file. Internet Explorer 11 shows a bar at the bottom of the browser window with an orange border.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin5.png\"></p>For any browser it is best to first save the file before proceeding, so click the “Save” button. By default, most browsers save downloaded files in the Downloads folder.</p><p>After downloading Enigmail, GPG4Win, and Mozilla Thunderbird you should have three new files in your Downloads folder:</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin6.png\"><h3>3 Installing the software</h3><h3>3.1 Installing GPG4Win</h3><p>Keep the Windows Explorer window open and double-click on gpg4win-xxx-x.x.x.exe. You'll be asked if you want to allow the installation of this program. Click the “Yes” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin7.png\"><p>A window will open, giving you an overview of what will be installed. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin8.png\"><p>A window with the license agreement will open up. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin9.png\"><p>The GPG4Win Vanilla package doesn't have components to select, so click the “Next “button again. For the GPG4Win-Light package, unselect all optional components to install GnuPG only.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin10.png\"><p>Next, you'll have the ability to choose where GPG is installed. Don't change the default setting. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin11.png\"><p>The next two windows will have some installation options. Click the “Next” button and then click the \"Install\" button:</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin12.png\"><img src=\"tool_pgpwin13.png\"><p>You will see a window with a progress bar—when it's done it will say “Installation Complete.” Click the “Next” button again.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin14.png\"><p>Finally, you are at the last installation step. Remove the check mark next to “Show the README file” and click the “Finish” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin15.png\"><p>That's it. Now let's move on to installing Mozilla Thunderbird.</p><h3>3.2 Installing Mozilla Thunderbird</h3><p>Similar to GPG4Win, you install Mozilla Thunderbird by double-clicking the Thunderbird Setup 24.6.0.exe file. As usual, you will be asked if you want to run this file. Click the “Run” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin16.png\"><p>You will be asked if you want to allow Mozilla Thunderbird to make a change to your computer by installing software. Click the “Yes” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin17.png\"><p>You will see the Mozilla Thunderbird Setup window. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin18.png\"><p>Next, you will get a choice between a Standard setup and a Custom setup. Keep the Standard setup selection and click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin18.png\"><p>You will be given a summary of where Mozilla Thunderbird's files will be installed. Click the “Install” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin19.png\"><p>When the installation process is complete, you will see a final window that enables you to launch Mozilla Thunderbird. Click the “Finish” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin20.png\"><h3>3.3. Enigmail installation</h3><p><b>Step 1. Preparation </b></p><p>When Mozilla Thunderbird launches for the first time, you will see this small confirmation window asking about some default settings. We recommend clicking the “Set as Default” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin21.png\"><p>Next, you will be asked whether you would like a new email address. Click the “Skip this and use my existing email” button. Now you will configure Mozilla Thunderbird to send and receive email. If you are used to only reading and sending email through gmail.com, outlook.com, or yahoo.com, Mozilla Thunderbird will be a new experience, but it isn't that different overall.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin22.png\"><p><b>Step 2. Adding a mail account to Mozilla Thunderbird</b></p><p>A new window will open.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin23.png\"><p>Enter your name, email address, and the password to your email account. Mozilla doesn't have access to your password or your email account. Click the “Continue” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin24.png\"><p>In many cases Mozilla Thunderbird will automatically detect the necessary settings. In some cases Mozilla Thunderbird doesn't have complete information and you'll need to enter it yourself. Here is an example of the instructions Google provides for Gmail:</p><p>Incoming Mail (IMAP) Server - Requires SSL<br>• imap.gmail.com<br>• Port: 993<br>• Requires SSL:Yes</p><p>Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - Requires TLS<br>• smtp.gmail.com<br>• Port: 465 or 587<br>• Requires SSL: Yes<br>• Requires authentication: Yes<br>• Use same settings as incoming mail server</p><p><b>Full Name or Display Name:</b> [your name or pseudonym]</p><p><b>Account Name or User Name:</b> your full Gmail address (username@gmail.com). Google Apps users, please enter username@your_domain.com</p><p><b>Email address:</b> your full Gmail address (username@gmail.com) Google Apps users, please enter username@your_domain.com</p><p><b>Password:</b> your Gmail password</p><p><b>If you use two-factor authentication with Google (and depending on your threat model you probably should!) you cannot use your standard Gmail password with Thunderbird. Instead, you will need to create a new application-specific password for Thunderbird to access your Gmail account. See <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1173270?hl=en\">Google's own guide</a> for doing this.</b></p><p>When all the information is entered correctly, click the “Done” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin25.png\"><p>Mozilla Thunderbird will start downloading copies of your email to your computer. Try sending a test email to your friends.</p><p><b>Step 3. Installing Enigmail</b></p><p>Enigmail is installed in a different way from Mozilla Thunderbird and GPG4Win. As mentioned before, Enigmail is an Add-on for Mozilla Thunderbird. Click the “Menu button,” also called the Hamburger button, and select “Add Ons.”</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin26.png\"><p>You'll be taken to the Add-ons Manager tab.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin27.png\"><p>Click the cog to bring up a small menu and select “Install add-on from file” which will bring up a file-selection window.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin28.png\"><p>The file selection window will very likely open to the Downloads folder. If it doesn't, go to the Downloads folder (where Enigmail was saved to) click on enigmail-1.7-tb+sm.xpi then click the “Open” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin29.png\"><p>Now you will see a small window asking you to confirm whether you want to install Enigmail. Click the “Install Now” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin30.png\"><p>After the Enigmail add-on is installed, Mozilla Thunderbird will ask to restart the browser to activate Enigmail. Click the “Restart Now” button and Mozilla Thunderbird will restart.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin31.png\"><p>When Mozilla Thunderbird restarts, an additional window will open up that will start the process of setting up the Enigmail add-on. Keep the “Yes, I would like the wizard to get me started” button selected and click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin32.png\"><p>Enigmail provides you with three options for handling mail. The default option is to encrypt emails if you have the “public key” of another person, Enigmail will encrypt the email you send but leave emails unencrypted if you don't have the public key of the recipient yet. You also have the option to encrypt emails all the time to everyone with PGP keys, which means that you will have to find the public keys for people for whom you don't have them already, or turn off automatic encryption  completely and only use PGP when directed.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin33.png\"><p>We don't know what the appropriate option is for you, but believe the “Convenient auto encryption” option to be a good choice. If you are in doubt, choose “Don't encrypt my messages by default.” Click the “Next” button.</p><p>Now you have an option to digitally sign all outgoing emails. Signing your email with PGP allows the recipient to check that you sent the message, and that the contents of the message were not tampered with. Click the “Sign my messages by default” button to turn this feature on. The downside of doing this, however, is that it can also flag to anyone you send mail to that you use PGP. <a href=\"www.cryptolaw.org/\">In some parts of the world</a> (including China, Iran, Belarus, and some Middle-East states) using unlicensed encryption, even for personal use, is illegal, so you might have very good reasons to not let others know you use PGP.</p><p>Click the “Next” Button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin34.png\"><p>Now you'll see an option to have Enigmail make some changes to the configuration of Mozilla Thunderbird.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin35.png\"><p>If you click the Details button you can review what those changes are.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin36.png\"><p>The following options can be unchecked (reenabled), for a more seamless transition, if you use PGP/Mime by default (we'll set that later):</p><p>• Disable flowed text<br>• View message body as plain text<br>• Do not compose HTML messages</p>The final option prevents potential problems in the encryption and decryption of your email. Be aware that selecting this box will remove the ability to send text that is bolded, underlined or colored. After reviewing the changes, click the “OK button.”</p><p>The small window will close. Click the “Next” button.</p><p>Now you will start creating your private key and public key.</p><h3>4 Creating a public key and private key</h3><p>Installation and setup of the Enigmail add-on is complete. Now you'll have the option of creating your public and private key pair. This assumes you have not created a private key before.</p><p>Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin37.png\"><p>Unless you have already configured more than one email account, Enigmail will choose the email account you've already configured. The first thing you'll need to do is come up with a strong passphrase for your private key. See the <b><a href=\"umbrella://lesson/passwords\">Passwords lesson</a></b> for more information on how to do this.</p><p>Make sure that you've written down this passphrase on paper until you have memorized it. Keep it somewhere where you can tell if it has been taken or viewed (like your wallet or purse). Just make sure you don't leave this paper lying around.</p><p>Click the “Next” button.</p><p>Enigmail will display some information about your private key as well as the configuration settings. We recommend creating 4096-bit length keys. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin38.png\"><p><b>Your key will expire at a certain time; when that happens, other people will stop using it entirely for new emails to you, though you might not get any warning or explanation about why. So, you may want to mark your calendar and pay attention to this issue a month or so before the expiration date.</b></p><p>It's possible to extend the lifetime of an existing key by giving it a new, later expiration date, or it's possible to replace it with a new key by creating a fresh one from scratch. Both processes might require contacting people who email you and making sure that they get the updated key; current software isn't very good at automating this. So make a reminder for yourself; if you don't think you'll be able to manage it, you can consider setting the key so that it never expires, though in that case other people might try to use it when contacting you far in the future even if you no longer have the private key or no longer use PGP.</p><p>Enigmail will generate the key and when it is complete, a small window will open asking you to generate a revocation certificate. This revocation certificate is important to have as it allows you to make the private key and public key invalid. It is important to note that merely deleting the private key does not invalidate the public key and may lead to people sending you encrypted mail that you can't decrypt.</p><p>Click the “Generate Certificate” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin39.png\"><p>A window will open to provide you a place to save the revocation certificate. While you can save the file to your computer, we recommend saving the file on a USB drive that you are using for nothing else and storing the drive in a safe spot. We also recommend removing the revocation certificate from the computer with the keys, just to avoid unintentional revocation.</p><p>Even better, save this file on a separate encrypted disk. Choose the location where you are saving this file and click the “Save” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin40.png\"><p>Now Enigmail will give you further information about saving the revocation certificate file again. Click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin41.png\"><p>Finally, you are done with generating the private key and public key. Click the “Finish” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin42.png\"><h3>5 Optional steps</h3><h3>5.1 Display long key-IDs</h3><p>The next steps are completely optional but they can be helpful when using OpenPGP and Enigmail. Briefly, the Key ID is a small part of the fingerprint. When it comes to verifying that a public key belongs to a particular person the fingerprint is the best way. Changing the default display makes it easier to read the fingerprints of the certificates you know about. Click the configuration button, then the Enigmail option, then Key Management.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin43.png\"><p>A window will open showing two columns: Name and Key ID.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin43.png\"><p>On the far right there is a small button. Click that button to configure the columns. Unclick the Key ID option and click the Fingerprint option.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin44.png\"><p>Now the columns will look like this:</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin45.png\"><p>Now you are set up to send and receive regular and encrypted email. Next you will go through the steps of actually finding the people to exchange encrypted mail with.</p><h3>5.2 Using PGP/MIME</h3><p>There is a final optional configuration step is to enable PGP/MIME which makes sending encrypted and signed attachments easier.</p><p>You can find this setting by clicking on the Menu Button, hovering over Options, then clicking Account Settings. The Account Settings window will open.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin46.png\"><p>When the Account Settings window opens click the OpenPGP Security tab then click the checkbox next to Use PGP/MIME by default. Next click the OK button. Now Enigmail will use PGP/MIME by default.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin47.png\"><p><b>Using PGP doesn't completely encrypt your email so that the sender and received information is encrypted. Encrypting the sender and receiver information would break email. Using Thunderbird with the Enigmail add-on gives you an easy way to encrypt and decrypt the content of your email.</b></p><h3>6.1 Letting others know you are using PGP</h3><p>Now that you have PGP, you want to let others know that you are using it so they can also send you encrypted messages using PGP.</p><p>Let's look at three different ways you can let people know you are using PGP.</p><p><b>a) Let people know you are using PGP with an email</b></p><p>You can easily email your public key to another person by sending them a copy as an attachment.</p><p>Click the “Write” button in Mozilla Thunderbird.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin48.png\"><p>Fill in an address and a subject, perhaps something like “my public key,” click the Enigmail menu and select the “Attach My Public Key” option.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin49.png\"><p>You can send the email and the recipient will be able to download and use the public key you sent.</p><p>If this method is used, it's a good idea to have the recipient verify your public key's fingerprint over some other form of communication, in case email is already being intercepted and tampered with.</p><p><b>b) Let people know you are using PGP on your website</b></p><p>In addition to letting people know via email, you can post your public key on your website. The easiest way is to upload the file and link to it. This guide won't go into how to do those things, but you should know how to export the certificate as a file to use in the future.</p><p>Click the configuration button, then the Enigmail option, then Key Management.</p><p>Highlight the certificate in bold, then right-click to bring up the menu and select Export keys to file.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin50.png\"><p>A small window will pop up with three buttons. Click the “Export Public Keys Only” button.</p><img src=\"tooL_pgpwin51.png\"><p>Make sure you don't click the “Export Secret Keys” button because exporting the secret key could allow others to impersonate you if they are able to guess your password.</p><p>Now a window will open so you can save the file. In order to make it easier to find in the future please save the file to the Documents folder.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin52.png\"><p>Now you can use this file as you wish.</p><p><b>c) Uploading to a keyserver</b></p><p>Keyservers make it easier to search for and download public keys. Most modern keyservers are synchronizing, meaning that a public key uploaded to one server will eventually reach all servers.</p><p>Although uploading your public key to a keyserver might be a convenient way of letting people know that you have a public PGP certificate, you should know that due to the nature of how keyservers work, there is no way to delete public keys once they are uploaded, you can only mark them as revoked.</p><p><b>Before uploading your public key to a keyserver, it is good to take a moment to consider whether you want the whole world to know that you have a public key without the ability to remove this information at a later time.</b></p><p>If you choose to upload your public key to keyservers, you will go back to the Enigmail Key Management window.</p><p>Click the Keyserver menu item and select the Upload Public Keys option.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin53.png\"><h3>6.2 Finding other people who are using PGP</h3><p><b>a) Getting a public key by email</b></p><p>You might get a public key sent to you as en email attachment.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin54.png\"><p>Double-click on the new message, and it'll open a new tab. Notice the attachment at the bottom of the window. Right-click on the attachment and select “Import OpenPGP Key.” A small window will open giving you the results of the import. Click the OK button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin55.png\"><p>If you open up the Enigmail key management window again, you can check the result. Your PGP key is in bold because you have both the private key and the public key. The public key you just imported is not bold because it doesn't contain the private key.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin56.png\"><p><b>b) Getting a public key as a file</b></p><p>It's possible that you get a public key by downloading it from a website or someone might have sent it through chat software. In a case like this, you will assume you downloaded the file to the Downloads folder.</p><p>Open the Enigmail Key Manager and click on the “File” menu. Select “Import Keys from File.”</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin57.png\"><p>The public key might have very different file name endings such as .asc, .pgp, or .gpg. Select the file and click the “Open” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin58.png\"><p>A small window will open, giving you the results of the import. Click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin59.png\"><p><b>c) Getting a public key from a key server</b></p><p>Keyservers can be a very useful way of getting public keys. Try looking for a public key. Open up the key manager then click the “Keyserver” menu and select “Search for Keys.”</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin60.png\"><p>A small window will pop up with a search field. You can search by a complete email address, a partial email address, or a name. In this case, you will search for certificates containing “eff.org.”</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin61.png\"><p>A larger window will pop up with many options. If you scroll down you'll notice some certificates are italicized and grayed out. These are certificates that have either been revoked or expired on their own.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin62.png\"><p>Let's take the public keys of Danny O'Brien for example, he has one expired or revoked certificate and one valid certificate. Select the valid certificate by clicking the box on the left then press the OK button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin63.png\"><p>In some cases a person may have more than one certificate, all appearing valid. Note that it's possible for anyone to upload a public certificate for anyone else, and that one of these keys may not belong to the person that owns the email address associated with it. In this case, verifying the fingerprint is extremely important.</p><p>A small notification window will pop up letting you know if you succeeded:</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin64.png\"><p>The Enigmail Key Manager will now show you the added certificates:</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin65.png\"><h3>7.1 Sending PGP encrypted mail</h3><p>Now you will send your first encrypted email to a recipient. In the main Mozilla Thunderbird window click the “Write” button. A new window will open.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin66.png\"><p>Write your message, and enter a recipient. For this test, select a recipient whose public key you already have. Enigmail will detect this and automatically encrypt the email.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin67.png\"><p><i>Note that the subject line won't be encrypted, so choose something innocuous, like “hello.”</i></p><p>When you click the “Send” button, you'll be given a window to enter the password to your PGP Key. Remember this is different from your email password!</p><p>Enter your password then click the “OK” button and your email will be encrypted and sent.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin68.png\"><p>The body of the email was encrypted and transformed. For example this text:</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin69.png\"><p>Will be transformed into:</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin70.png\"><h3>7.2 Receiving PGP encrypted mail</h3><p>Let's go through what happens when you receive encrypted email. Notice that that Mozilla Thunderbird is letting you know you have new mail. Click on the message.</p><img src=\"too.png;_pgpwin71\"><p>A small window opens asking you for the password to the PGP key. Remember: Don't enter your email password. Click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin72.png\"><p>Now the message will show up decrypted</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin73.png\"><h3>8 Revoking the PGP Key</h3><p><b>a) Revoking your PGP Key through the Enigmail interface</b></p><p>The PGP keys generated by Enigmail automatically expire after five years. So if you lose all your files, you can hope that people will know to ask you for another key once the key has expired.</p><p>You might have a good reason to disable the PGP key before it expires. Perhaps you want to generate a new, stronger PGP key. The easiest way to revoke your own PGP key in Enigmail is through the Enigmail Key Manager.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin74.png\"><p>Right-click on your PGP key (it's in bold), and select the “Revoke Key” option.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin75.png\"><p>A window will pop up letting you know what happens and asking for your confirmation. Click the “Revoke Key” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin76.png\"><p>The password window opens, enter your password for the PGP key and click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin77.png\"><p>Now a new window will open up letting you know you succeeded. Click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin78.png\"><p>When you go back to the Enigmail Key Management window you'll notice a change to your PGP key. It is now grayed out and italicized.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin79.png\"><p><b>b) Revoking a PGP Key with a revocation certificate</b></p><p>As mentioned before, the PGP keys generated by Enigmail automatically expire after five years. So if you lose all your files you can be sure that people will know to ask you for another key once the key has expired.</p><p>Like we mentioned before, you might have a good reason to disable the PGP key before it expires.</p><p>Similarly, others might have good reasons to revoke an existing key.</p><p>You might get sent revocation certificates from friends as a notice that they want to revoke their key.</p><p>In the previous section you might have noticed that Enigmail generates and imports a revocation certificate internally when you use the Enigmail Key Manager to revoke a key. Since you already have a revocation certificate, you will use the one you generated earlier to revoke your own key.</p><p>Start with the Enigmail Key Manager and click the “File” menu and select “Import Keys from File.”</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin80.png\"><p>A window will open up so you can select the revocation certificate. Click on the file, and click the “Open” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin81.png\"><p>You'll get a notification that the certificate was imported successfully and that a key was revoked. Click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin82.png\"><p>Once you click the “OK” button, you'll be taken back to the Enigmail Key Manager and you see the certificate you revoked greyed out and italicized.</p><img src=\"tool_pgpwin83.png\"><p>If the key you revoked is your own, and you previously uploaded your public key to the key servers, you will want to re-upload the now-revoked key to the key servers, so that others see not to use it anymore.</p><p>Now that you have all the proper tools, try sending your own PGP-encrypted email.</p>"));

For instance, if you are using Pidgin to access your Google Talk account, you will not be able to chat with a friend using an ICQ account.<br>• However, Pidgin can be configured to manage multiple accounts based on any of the supported messaging protocols. That is, you may simultaneously use both Gmail and ICQ accounts, and chat with correspondents using either of those specific services (which are supported by Pidgin).<br>• Pidgin, automatically logs conversations by default, however you do have the ability to disable this feature. That said, you do not have control over the person with whom you are chatting—she could be logging or taking screenshots of your conversation, even if you yourself have disabled logging.</p><p><b>Why should I use Pidgin + OTR?</b><p>When you have a chat conversation using Google Hangouts or Facebook chat on the Google or Facebook websites, that chat is encrypted using HTTPS, which means the content of your chat is protected from hackers and other third parties while it’s in transit. It is not, however, protected from Google or Facebook, which have the keys to your conversations and can hand them over to authorities.</p><p>After you have installed Pidgin, you can sign in to it using multiple accounts at the same time. For example, you could use Google Hangouts, Facebook, and XMPP simultaneously. Pidgin also allows you to chat using these tools without OTR. Since OTR only works if both people are using it, this means that even if the other person does not have it installed, you can still chat with them using Pidgin.</p><p>Pidgin also allows you to do out-of-band verification to make sure that you’re talking to the person you think you’re talking to. For every conversation, there is an option that will show you the key fingerprints it has for you and the person with whom you are chatting. A \"key fingerprint \" is a string of characters like \"342e 2309 bd20 0912 ff10 6c63 2192 1928,” that’s used to verify a longer public key. Exchange your fingerprints through another communications channel, such as Twitter DM or email, to make sure that no one is interfering with your conversation.</p><p><b>Limitations: When should I not use Pidgin + OTR?</b></p><p>Pidgin is a complex program, which has not been written with security as a top priority. It almost certainly has bugs, some of which might be used by governments or even big companies to break into computers that are using it. Using Pidgin to encrypt your conversations is a great defence against the kind of untargeted surveillance that is used to spy on everyone's Internet conversations, but if you think you will be personally targeted by a well-resourced attacker (like a nation-state), you should consider stronger precautions, such as PGP -encrypted email.</p><h3>2 Downloading and installing</h3><h3>2.1 Getting Pidgin</h3><p>You can get Pidgin on Windows by downloading the installer from the Pidgin download page.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin1.png\"><p>Click on the <i>purple</i> DOWNLOAD tab. <i><b>Don't</b> click the green Download Now button because you’ll want to choose a different installer file.</i> <p>You'll be taken to the download page.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin2.png\"><p><i>Again, <b>don't</b> click the green Download Now button because we want to choose a different installer file. </i><p>The default installer for Pidgin is small because it doesn't contain all the information and downloads the files for you. This sometimes fails so you will have a better experience with the “offline installer” which contains all the necessary installation material. </p><p>Click the “<b>offline installer</b>” link. You will be taken to a new page titled “Sourceforge” and after a few seconds, a small popup will ask whether you want to save a file.</p><p>• Note: While Pidgin's download page uses \"HTTPS\" and is therefore relatively safe from tampering, the website it directs you to to download the Windows version of Pidgin is currently Sourceforge, which uses unencrypted \"HTTP,\" and therefore offers no protection. That means that the software you download could be tampered with before you download it. This risk would mostly come from either someone with access to the local Internet infrastructure attempting to conduct targeted surveillance against you personally (for instance a malicious hot-spot provider), or a state or government planning to distribute compromised software to many users. The <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS Everywhere</a> extension can rewrite Sourceforge download URLs to HTTPS, so it's recommended you install HTTPS Everywhere before downloading any other software. Additionally, in our experience, Sourceforge often has confusing full-page ads on its download pages that can trick people into installing something they may not want to.  You can install an ad blocker before any other software to avoid these confusing ads. </p><p>Many browsers will ask you to confirm whether you want to download this file. Internet Explorer 11 shows a bar at the bottom of the browser window with an orange border.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin3.png\"><p>For any browser, it is best to first save the file before proceeding, so click the “Save” button. By default, most browsers save downloaded files in the Downloads folder.</p><h3>2.2 Getting OTR</h3><p>You can get pidgin-otr, the OTR plugin for Pidgin, by downloading the installer from the <a href=\"https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/\">OTR download page</a>.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin4.png\"><p>Click the “Downloads” tab to be taken to the “Downloads” section of the page. Click the “Win32 installer for pidgin” link.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin5.png\"><p>Many browsers will ask you to confirm whether you want to download this file. Internet Explorer 11 shows a bar at the bottom of the browser window with an orange border.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin6.png\"><p>For any browser, it is best to first save the file before proceeding, so click the “Save” button. By default, most browsers save downloaded files in the Downloads folder.</p><p>After downloading Pidgin and pidgin-otr you should have two new files in your </p><p>Downloads folder:</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin7.png\"><h3>2.3 Installing Pidgin</h3><p>Keep the Windows Explorer window open and double-click on pidgin-2.10.9-offline.exe. You'll be asked if you want to allow the installation of this program. Click the “Yes” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin8.png\"><p>A small window opens asking you to select a language. Click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin9.png\"><p>A window opens up giving you a quick overview of the installation process. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin10.png\"><p>Now you get a license overview. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin11.png\"><p>Now you can see what different components are installed. Don't change the settings. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin12.png\"><p>Now you can see where Pidgin will be installed. Don't change this information. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin13.png\"><p>Now you'll see a window with scrolling text until it says “Installation Complete.” Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin14.png\"><p>Finally, you’ll see the last window of the Pidgin installer. Click the “Finish” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin15.png\"><h3>2.4 Installing pidgin-otr</h3><p>Go back to the Windows Explorer window and open and double-click on pidgin-otr-4.0.0-1.exe. You'll be asked if you want to allow the installation of this program. Click the “Yes” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin16.png\"><p>A window opens up giving you a quick overview of the installation process. Click the “Next” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin17.png\"><p>Now you get a license overview. Click the “I Agree” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin18.png\"><p>You will see where pidgin-otr will be installed. Don't change this information. Click the “Install” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin19.png\"><p>Finally, you’ll see the last window of the pidgin-otr installer. Click the “Finish” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin20.png\"><h3>3 Configuration</h3><h3>3.1 Configuring Pidgin</h3><p>Go to the Start menu, click the Windows icon, and select Pidgin from the menu.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin21.png\"><h3>3.2 Adding an account</h3><p>When Pidgin launches for the first time, you will see this welcome window giving you an option to add an account. Since you don't have an account configured yet, click the “Add” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin22.png\"><p>Now you'll see the “Add Account” window. </p><p><b><i>Pidgin is able to work with many chat systems, such as AIM, Facebook, GoogleTalk, MSN, MXit and Yahoo, but here we'll focus on XMPP, formerly known as Jabber.</i></b></p><p>At the Protocol entry, select the “XMPP” option.</p><p>At the Username entry, enter your XMPP username.</p><p>At the Domain entry, enter the domain of your XMPP account.</p><p>At the Password entry, enter your XMPP password.</p><p>Checking the box by the “Remember password” entry will make accessing your account easier. Be aware that by clicking “Remember password,” your password will be saved on the computer, making it accessible to anyone who may happen to access your computer. If this is a concern, do not check this box. You will then be required to enter your XMPP account password every time you start Pidgin.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin23.png\"><h3>3.3 Adding a Buddy</h3><p>Now you will want to add someone to chat with. Click the “Buddies” menu and select “Add Buddy.” An “Add Buddy” window will open.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin24.png\"><p>At the “Add Window,” you can enter the username of the person you want to chat with. This other user does not have to be from the same server, but does have to use the same protocol, such as XMPP.</p><p>At the “Buddy's username” entry, enter your buddy’s username with the domain name. This will look like an email address.</p><p>At the “(Optional) Alias” entry, you can enter a name of your choice for your buddy. This is entirely optional, but can help if the XMPP account of the person you are chatting with is hard to remember.</p><p>Click the “Add” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin25.png\"><p>Once you have clicked the “Add” button, Boris will get a message asking if he gives authorization for you to add him. Once Boris does, he adds your account and you will get the same request. </p><p>Click the “Authorize” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin26.png\"><h3>3.4 Configuring the OTR plugin</h3><p>Now you will configure the OTR plugin so you can chat securely. Click the “Tools” menu and select the “Plugins” option.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin27.png\"><p>Scroll down to the “Off-the-Record Messaging” option, and check the box. </p><p>Click on the “Off-the-Record Messaging” entry and click the “Configure Plugin” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin28.png\"><p>Now you will see the “Off-the-Record Messaging” configuration window. Notice that is says “No key present.” </p><p>Click the “Generate” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin29.png\"><p>Now a small window will open and generate a key. When it is done, click the “OK” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin30.png\"><p>You'll see new information: a 40 character string of text, broken up into 5 groups of eight characters. This is your OTR fingerprint. Click the “Close” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin31.png\"><p>Now click the “Close” button on the Plugins window.</p><h3>4.0 Chatting securely</h3><p>You are now able to chat with Boris. The two of you can send messages back and forth. However, we're still not chatting securely. Even if you are connecting to the XMPP server, it is possible that the connection between you and Boris is not secure from snooping. </p><p>If you look at the chat window, notice that it says “Not private” in red on the bottom right. Click the “Not private” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin32.png\"><p>A menu will open up, select “Authenticate buddy.”</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin33.png\"><p>A window will open up. You are asked: “How would you like to authenticate your buddy?”</p><p>The drop-down has three options:</p><p><b>Option 1: Shared secret</b></p><p>A shared secret is a line of text you and the person you want to chat have agreed to use ahead of time. You should have shared this in person and never have exchanged it over insecure channels such as email or Skype.</p><p>You and your buddy need to enter this text together. Click the “Authenticate” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin34.png\"><p>The shared secret verification is useful if you and your buddy have already made arrangements to chat in the future but haven't yet created OTR fingerprints on the computer you are using.</p><p><b>Option 2: Manual fingerprint verification</b></p><p>Manual fingerprint verification is useful if you were already given your buddy's fingerprint and are now connecting with Pidgin. This will not be useful if your buddy changed computers or had to create new fingerprints.</p><p>If the fingerprint you were given and the fingerprint on the screen match, select “I have” and click the “Authenticate” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin35.png\"><p><b>Option 3: Question and answer</b></p><p>Question and answer verification is useful if you know your buddy but have not established a shared secret nor had a chance to share fingerprints. This method is useful to establish verification based on something both of you know, like a shared event or memory.</p><p>Enter the question you want to ask. Don't make it so simple that someone can guess it easily, but don't make it impossible. An example of a good question would be “Where did we go for dinner in Minneapolis?” And example of a bad question would be “Can you buy apples in Tokyo?”</p><p><b>The answers must match exactly; so keep that in mind when choosing an answer to your question. Capitalization matters, so you might consider including a note like (for example: use capitals, lower case).</b></p><p>Enter the question and answer then click the “Authenticate” button.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin36.png\"><p>Your buddy will have a window open with the question displayed asking for the answer. They will have to answer and click the “Authenticate” button. Then they will receive a message letting them know if the authentication was successful.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin37.png\"><img src=\"tool_pidgin38.png\"><p>Once your buddy had completed the authentication procedure, you will get a window letting you know the authentication succeeded.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin39.png\"><p>Your buddy should also verify your account so that both of you can be sure that the communication is secure. Here is what it would like for Akiko and Boris. Notice the green “Private” icons in the lower right of the chat window.</p><img src=\"tool_pidgin40.png\"><h3>5 Working with other software</h3><p>The mechanisms to verify the authenticity should work between different chat software such as Jitsi, Pidgin, Adium, and Kopete. You are not required to use the same chat software to use chat over XMPP and OTR, but sometimes there are errors in the software. Adium, a chat software for OS X, has an error receiving the Question and Answer verification. If you find that verifying others is failing for you when you are using Question and Answer verification, check whether they are using Adium and see if you can use another verification method.</p>"));

While it is connecting, a spinning icon is displayed. </p><p>You can select one of the following tunnel modes: <b>VPN, SSH, or SSH+ </b></p><p>• We recommend that you <b>select the VPN</b> option, which means all of your traffic automatically tunnels through Psiphon.<br>• The key difference between SSH/SSH+ and VPN is that SSH is application specific while a VPN encrypts all traffic on your computer. With VPN, you turn on the VPN and then all your traffic is encrypted so the web browser, Skype, and email would all bypass censorship as long as the VPN is on.<br>• In Psiphon’s SSH and SSH+ modes, it automatically sets the proxy settings and traffic for applications that respect these settings tunnel through Psiphon. These settings are respected by default by all major web browsers. SSH plus obfuscation adds a randomized layer on top of SSH to avoid protocol fingerprinting. <br>• In SSH and SSH+ modes, Psiphon offers a split option where international traffic is tunnelled through the proxy and domestic traffic is not. Check the “Don’t proxy...” option to enable split tunnelling. When this option is on, unproxied domains are reported in the message area. <br>• Use SSH/SSH+ options if you want to access domestic sites quickly and your threat model allows it. However we recommend <b>selecting the VPN option</b>.</p><p>Connection to the Psiphon server is established when the green tick icon is displayed on the left of the window. </p><img src=\"tool_psiphon4.png\"><p>When you close the program, Psiphon automatically disconnects. You can also click on the icon to toggle the connection.</p><p>Remember that:<br>• Because Psiphon 3 is VPN-based, it is able to proxy all of your Internet traffic, not just websites<br>• Traffic between your PC and the VPN server is encrypted, HOWEVER the traffic between that server and a non-HTTPS website will not be encrypted. (The same applies to other Internet services, such as when connecting with Outlook or Thunderbird to a non-SSL email provider.)<br>• If you have not established a connection, you are not using the VPN. Just because you have Psiphon 3 sitting on your computer somewhere does not mean your requests go through the proxy.<br>• Web pages may load more slowly when using a VPN. This is normal and it is because the browser is not connecting directly to the website<br>• Some paid VPN services may be faster than free ones like Psiphon 3, but you should be careful before trusting a business with your information, as it could be shared with other organisations or sold to other companies</p>"));

This will activate the installation progress bar that will disappear after the installation has completed itself in a few minutes.</p><p><b>Step 8.</b> Click “Finish” to complete installing Recuva.</p><p>Now that you have successfully installed Recuva, you are ready to begin recovering and/or overwriting private and sensitive information. </p><h3>How to Perform Different Scans Using Recuva</h3><h3>3.0 Before You Begin</h3><p>In this section, you will learn how to perform different types of scans, and be introduced to the <i>General</i> and <i>Actions</i> tabs in the <i>Options</i> screen. <b>Note:</b> A scan will simply retrieve and display the files which are potentially recoverable. The actual recovery procedures are discussed in the next section.</p><h3>3.1 How to Perform a Scan Using the Recuva Wizard</h3><p>The Recuva <i>Wizard</i> is recommended in situations where neither the full nor partial name of the file you would like to recover is known. It is also recommended if this is the first time you are using Recuva. The Recuva <i>Wizard</i> lets you set the scan parameters by letting you specify the file type and/or from where the file was deleted.</p><p>To begin scanning for deleted files, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click the Recuva icon or select Start > Programs > Recuva > Recuva to launch the program, and activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva2.png\"><p><b>Tip:</b> If you know the exact or even partial name of a file you would like to recover, click “Cancel” to go to the <i>Piriform Recuva</i> main user interface, and then follow the steps in section 3.2 How to Perform a Scan without Using the Recuva Wizard.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva3.png\"><p>The <i>Recuva Wizard File type</i> displays a list of different file types, and describes what files might be recovered when each option is enabled.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Check the <i>Other</i> option, and then click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva4.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> The default setting for the <i>Recuva Wizard File Location</i> screen is the <i>I'm not sure option</i>. This option will extend the scan to all drives as well as removable media, except CDs, DVDs and optical media. It may, therefore, require a longer time to generate results.</p><p>Files are most frequently deleted from Recycle Bin in the Windows operating systems, to minimize the chance of your accidentally deleting private or sensitive information.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Check the <i>In the Recycle Bin</i> option as shown above, and then click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva5.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> For this exercise, do not enable the <i>Deep Scan</i> option. This scanning technique will be discussed in section 3.3 How to Perform a Deep Scan.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Start” to begin recovering your deleted files.</p><p>During the file recovery process, two progress status bars appear in quick succession. The <i>Scanning the drive for deleted files</i> progress bar lists the deleted files. The <i>Analyzing the file contents</i> progress bar groups and sorts the deleted files into file types and degree of recoverability. They also display the duration of the scanning and analysis processes. Your <i>Piriform Recuva</i> main user interface may then resemble the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_revua6.png\"><p>The <i>Piriform Recuva</i> main user interface lists information about each deleted file, arranged in six columns. Each column is described as follows:</p><p><b>Filename</b> This displays the name and file extension of the deleted file. Click the <i>Filename</i> title to arrange the deleted files in alphabetical order.</p><p><b>Path:</b> This displays where the deleted file was found. Given that the <i>In the Recycle Bin</i> option was enabled in this example, the file path is <i>C:RECYCLER</i> for all the deleted files. Click the <i>Path</i> title to view all the files listed under a particular directory or file path.</p><p><b>Last modified:</b> This displays the last time the file was modified before it was deleted, and can be useful in helping to identify the file you would like to recover. Click <i>Last modified</i> to list the deleted files according to the oldest or most recent.</p><p><b>Size:</b> This displays the size of the file. Click <i>Size</i> to list the deleted files beginning with the largest or smallest deleted file.</p><p><b>Status:</b> This displays the extent to which the file is recoverable, and corresponds to the file status icons discussed below. Click <i>Status</i> to sort the deleted files into the three basic categories, and list them from <i>Excellent</i> to <i>Unrecoverable</i>.</p><p><b>Comment:</b> This displays why a given file may or may not be recoverable, and the extent to which a deleted file has been overwritten in the Windows Master File Table. Click <i>Comment</i> to view the extent to which a file or group of files have been overwritten.</p><p>Each file is associated with a coloured status icon which indicates the extent to which each file can be successfully recovered:</p><p>The following list describes each status icon:</p><p>• Green: The chances for a full recovery are excellent.<br>• Orange: The chances for recovery are acceptable.<br>• Red: The chances for recovery are unlikely.</p><h3>3.2 How to Perform a Scan without Using the Recuva Wizard</h3><p>To access the Recuva main user interface directly, (that is, not use the <i>Recuva Wizard</i>), perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click the Recuva icon or select Start > Programs > Recuva > Recuva.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Check the <i>Do not show this Wizard on startup</i> option, then click “Cancel” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva7.png\"><p>The <i>Piriform Recuva</i> main user interface is divided into the results pane on the left and the <i>Preview</i>, <i>Info</i> and <i>Header</i> tabs in which to sort and view information about a specific deleted file. It lets you set certain scan options, similar to those in the <i>Recuva Wizard</i>.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click to activate the drop-down list and select the drive to be scanned; the <i>Local Disk (C:)</i> is the default and used in this example as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva8.png\"><p>The <i>Filename</i> or <i>path</i> drop-down list lets you specify the kind of file you are looking for, and loosely corresponds to the <i>Recuva Wizard File type</i> screen.</p><img src=\"tool_recuva9.png\"><p>The <i>Filename</i> or <i>path</i> feature is a combination of a text box and drop-down list. It has two main uses: To let you directly search for a specific file, and/or to sort through a list of deleted files, according to file type.</p><p>Alternatively, the <i>Filename</i> or <i>path</i> feature can be used to search for files of a specific type, or to sort through a general list of deleted files in the results pane.</p><p>To begin scanning for a file of which all or part of the name is known, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Type in the name or partial name of a file you would like to recover as follows (in this example, the file <i>triangle.png</i> is being scanned):</p><img src=\"tool_recuva10.png\"><p>Tip:<b> Click X to reset the <i>File name and path</i> (which appear greyed out).</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Scan” to begin scanning for your deleted file(s); shortly thereafter, a screen will appear resembling the following:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva11.png\"><h3>3.3 How to Perform a Deep Scan Using Recuva</h3><p>The <i>Enable Deep Scan</i> option lets you conduct a more thorough scan; naturally, a deep scan takes a longer time, depending on your computer speed and the number of files you have. This option might prove useful if your initial scan does not display the files you would have liked to recover. Although a deep scan may even take hours depending on the amount of data stored on your computer, it may improve your chances of recovering the files you require.</p><p>The Recuva <i>Deep Scan</i> option can be enabled either through checking the <i>Enable Deep Scan</i> option in the <i>Recuva Wizard</i>.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click “Options” to activate the <i>Options</i> screen, then click the <i>Actions</i> tab as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva12.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Check the <i>Deep Scan (increases scan time)</i> option, then click “OK”.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Scan” to begin scanning for deleted files using the <i>Deep Scan</i> option. As mentioned earlier, a deep scan can potentially take a few hours, depending on the size of your hard disk and computer speed:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva13.png\"><h3>3.4 An Introduction to the Options Screen</h3><p>In this section, you will learn how to use the different settings to successfully recover and overwrite your private or sensitive information in the <i>Options</i> screen. To configure these settings, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1:</b> Click “Options” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva14.png\"><p>The <i>Options</i> screen is divided into the <i>General</i>, <i>Actions</i> and <i>About</i> tabs.</p><p>The <i>General</i> tab lets you define a number of important settings, including <i>Language</i> (Recuva supports 37 languages), <i>View mode</i> and disabling or enabling the <i>Recuva Wizard</i>.</p><img src=\"tool_recuva15.png\"><p>The View Mode lets you select how you would like to view the deleted files, and can also be enabled whenever you right click a file in the <i>Piriform Recuva</i>.</p><p>• <b>List:</b> This option lets you view the deleted files in a list<br>• <b>Tree:</b> This option lets you view the directory path of deleted files in the form of an expandable tree.<br>• <b>Thumbnails:</b> This option lets you view the deleted files as graphics or images where possible.</p><p>Most importantly perhaps, the <i>Advanced</i> section of the <i>General</i> tab lets you set the number of times your data can be overwritten by random data to protect it from recovery by hostile or malicious parties.</p><p>The <i>Secure overwriting</i> drop-down list displays four options for overwriting your private information. Its default mode is <i>Simple Overwrite (1 pass)</i>. A pass refers to the number of times your document, file or folder will be overwritten with random data to render it completely unreadable.</p><p><b>Step 2: Select</b> the <i>DOD 5220.22-M (3 passes)</i> option as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva16.png\"><p>A single pass may prove quite effective in overwriting a given document, file or folder; however, there are parties with the resources and skills to recover a relatively light secure overwrite. Three passes is a solid balance between the time required to perform a secure overwrite, and the ability to recover that document, file or folder.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “OK” to save your <i>General</i> tab configuration options.</p><img src=\"tool_recuva17.png\"><p>• <b>Show files found in hidden system directories:</b> This option lets you display files in hidden system directories.</p><p>• <b>Show zero-byte files:</b> This option lets you show you files that have little to no content, and which are basically irrecoverable.Show securely deleted files: This option lets you display files that have been securely deleted in the results pane.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you have already used CCleaner or a similar program, it changes the filename to ZZZZZZZ.ZZZ when it securely deletes a file, for security reasons.</p><p>• <b>Deep Scan:</b> This option lets you scan the entire drive for the deleted document or file; if previous scans have proven ineffective in locating your file, the Deep Scan may prove useful. However, it does require more time. Please refer to section 3.3 How to Perform a Deep Scan Using Recuva.</p><p>• <b>Scan for non-deleted files (for recovery from damaged or reformatted disks):</b> This option lets you attempt to recover files from disks that may have sustained physical damage or software-related corruption.</p><p>The <i>About</i> tab displays version information, as well as links to the Piriform web site.</p><p>Now that you are more confident about performing different scans and familiar with the settings in the <i>General</i> and <i>Actions</i> tabs in the Options screen, you are ready to learn how to actually recover and/or securely overwrite your private or sensitive information.</p><h3>How to Recover and Securely Overwrite Files Using Recuva</h3><h3>4.0 Before You Begin</h3><p>In this section, you will learn how to recover a previously deleted file, as well as how to securely overwrite any private or sensitive information.</p><p>Recuva lets you create a new folder for storing your recovered files. Although Recuva does let you use existing folders, for reasons of safety and security, we recommend that you copy your recovered files to a removable device like a backup drive or USB memory stick.</p><p><b>Important:</b> Although Recuva does an excellent job of securely overwriting information, it may leave a file marker indicating the existence of such a file. To protect your privacy and security, it makes sense to save any important, private or sensitive information to a removable device, and not to the original location or path.</p><h3>4.1 How to Recover a Deleted File</h3><p>To begin recovering a deleted file, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Connect your removable disk or a USB memory stick to your computer.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Check the check box next to a file you want to recover to enable the Recover... button or double click that file to both check and highlight that file.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Recover…” to activate the <i>Browse For Folder</i> screen.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Select a destination and then click “Make New Folder” to create your recovery folder as shown below.</p><img src=\"tool_recuva18.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> In this example, the folder for storing your recovered documents and files has been given an obvious label. However, keeping your digital privacy and security in mind, we encourage you to be more careful in labelling your own folder.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Yes” to begin the file recovery process; a progress status screen appears as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva19.png\"><p>After the files have been recovered, a confirmation will appear resembling the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva20.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> Recuva supports multiple file recovery. Simply check the check boxes of the files you would like to recover and perform steps <b>3</b> to <b>5</b>.</p><p>Now that you are comfortable with recovering a previously deleted file, you are ready to learn how to use the pop-up menu to perform multiple file recoveries and secure overwriting of files.</p><h3>4.2 How to Use the Pop-up Menu</h3><p>Recuva offers different options for selecting the documents, files or folders you would like to delete or securely overwrite.</p><p>• <b>Checking</b> is generally used to quickly select several non-contiguous or separate files for recovery or secure overwriting.<br>• <b>Highlighting</b> is generally used to quickly select contiguous multiple files in a block or group for recovery or secure overwriting.</p><p>Right click on a deleted file displayed in the Recuva main to activate the following pop-up menu:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva21.png\"><p><b>Recover Highlighted:</b> This item lets you recover all or any highlighted deleted file(s).</p><p><b>Recover Checked:</b> This item lets you recover a checked deleted file.</p><p><b>Check Highlighted:</b> This item lets you check a highlighted deleted file.</p><p><b>Uncheck Highlighted:</b> This item lets you uncheck a highlighted deleted file.</p><p>As you recall, the View Mode can also be set in the <i>General</i> tab in the <i>Options</i> screen. This item lets you select how you would like to view the deleted files.</p><p>• <b>List:</b> This option lets you view the deleted files in a list as in Figure 5<br>• <b>Tree:</b> This option lets you view the directory path of deleted files in the form of an expandable tree.<br>• <b>Thumbnails:</b> This option lets you view the deleted files as graphics or images where possible.</p><p><b>Highlight Folder:</b> This option lets you select multiple deleted files according to their directory path, and lets you perform the actions listed in the pop-up menu on them.</p><p><b>Secure Overwrite Highlighted:</b> This option lets you securely overwrite a highlighted deleted file.</p><p><b>Secure Overwrite Checked:</b> This option lets you securely overwrite a checked deleted file, changing its status icon to red.</p><h3>4.3 How to Securely Overwrite a Deleted File</h3><p>To securely overwrite a deleted file, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Check the individual file you would like to have securely overwritten, and then right click the check box it to activate the pop-up menu.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select “Secure Overwrite Checked” to activate the following confirmation dialog box:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva22.png\"><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Yes” to begin the overwriting process; depending on the size and status of the file as well as the <i>Secure overwriting</i> option you selected in the <i>General</i> tab in the <i>Options</i> screen, this could take some time. After the overwriting process has been completed, a screen resembling the following appears:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva23.png\"><p>You have successfully completed recovering and securely overwriting files using Recuva previously deleted files.</p><h3>5 PORTABLE RECUVA</h3><h3>5.1 Differences between the Installed and Portable Versions of Recuva</h3><p>Given that portable tools are not installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses.</p><p>There are no other differences between Portable Recuva and the version designed to be installed.</p><h3>5.2 How to Download and Extract Recuva Portable</h3><p>To begin downloading and extracting Recuva Portable, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click <a href=\"http://www.piriform.com/recuva/download/portable\">http://www.piriform.com/recuva/download/portable</a> to be directed to the appropriate download site, and automatically activate the following screen:</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “OK” to save the <i>rcsetup140.zip</i> installation file to your computer; and then navigate to it.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Right click to activate the Windows pop-up menu, and then select the Extract files... item as shown below:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva24.png\"><p><b>Step 4.</b> Navigate to the removable drive or USB memory stick as shown below, and then click “New Folder” to create a new folder in which to extract the installation file.</p><img src=\"tool_recuva25.png\"><p><b>Step 5.</b> Enter a name for the new folder in the document tree as shown below:</p><img src=\"tool_recuva26.png\"><p>Alternatively, you may type in a folder name in the accompanying drop-down list: </p><img src=\"tool_recuva27.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> Although for the purposes of this example, the new folder is entitled Recuva Portable, users may choose different name.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Click “OK” to begin extracting its contents to newly created folder.</p><p><b>Step 7.</b> Navigate to your destination external drive or USB memory stick, as shown below, then open it to confirm that the Portable Recuva program was successfully extracted.</p><img src=\"tool_recuva28.png\"><p><b>Step 8.</b> Double click <i>Recuva.exe</i> to activate the Portable Recuva wizard.</p><p>Please refer to the rest of the Recuva tool guide above to begin configuring and using it.</p>"));

When you first send a message to another contact that uses the app, the app will initiate a key exchange message with the other user.</p><p>You will want to verify keys with the other user (for more information, view the EFF module on <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/node/37/\">Key Verification</a>). To view the keys, click on the padlock icon in the top right of the screen and select “Verify Identity.” You will be shown two sets of keys: one belonging to you and one belonging to the other user.</p><p>TextSecure supports manual verification or verification by scanning the other user’s barcode. If you are in the same room as the other person, you can easily scan the barcode on their phone (reachable by clicking on the lock icon on the menu bar at the top of your conversation, selecting “verify identity” and then clicking on the barcode icon) or read your keys aloud to one another.</p><p>If you are not in the same room, there are different ways to verify keys with varying degrees of trustworthiness. For example, you can read your keys aloud to one another on the phone if you recognize one another’s voices or send them using another verified method of communication such as PGP or OTR.</p>"));

It functions like an electronic safe, letting you lock up your files so that only someone with the correct password can open them. TrueCrypt works by letting you set up <i>volumes</i> or sections on your computer where you can securely store files. When you create data in, or move data to these volumes, TrueCrypt will automatically encrypt that information. As you open or take your files out, it automatically decrypts them for use. This process is called <i>on-the-fly</i> encryption.</p><h3>2.2 How to Create a Standard Volume</h3><p>TrueCrypt lets you create two kinds of volumes: <i>Hidden</i> and <i>Standard</i>. In this section, you will learn how to create a <i>Standard Volume</i> in which to store your files.</p><p>To begin using TrueCrypt to create a <i>Standard Volume</i>, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Double click on the TrueCrypt icon or Select <b>Start > Programs > TrueCrypt > TrueCrypt</b> to open TrueCrypt.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select a drive from the list in the TrueCrypt pane as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt5.png\"><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Create Volume” to activate the <i>TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard</i> as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt6.png\"><p>There are three options for encrypting a <i>Standard Volume</o>. In this guide, we will use the Create an encrypted file container option. Please refer to the <a href=\"www.truecrypt.org/docs/\"><b>TrueCrypt</b> documentation</a> for the description of other two options.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt7.png\"><p>The <i>TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard Volume Type</i> window lets you specify whether you would prefer to create a <i>Standard</i> or <i>Hidden <b>TrueCrypt</b></i> volume.</p><p>For more information about <i>How to Create a Hidden Volume</i>, please refer to the Hidden Volumes section further down.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Check the <i>Standard TrueCrypt Volume</i> option.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt8.png\"><p>You can specify where you would like to store your <i>Standard Volume</i> in the <i>Volume Creation Wizard - Volume Location</i> screen. This file can be stored like any other file.</p><p><b>Step 7.</b> Either type in the name of the file into the text field, or click “Select File” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt9.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> A TrueCrypt Volume is contained inside a normal file. This means that it can be moved, copied or even deleted! You need to remember both the location and name of the file. However, you must choose new file name for the volume you create. In this tutorial, we will create our Standard Volume in the <b>My Documents folder</b>, and name the file <i>My Volume</i> as shown in <i>figure 8</i> above.</p><p><b>Tip:</b> You can use any file name and file extension. For example, you can name your Standard Volume <i>recipes.doc</i>, so that it will look like a <i>Word</i> document, or <i>holidays.mpg</i>, so it will look like a movie file. This is one way you can help disguise the existence of your Standard Volume.</p><p><b>Step 8.</b> Click “Save” to close the <i>Specify Path</i> and <i>File Name</i> window and return to the <i>Volume Creation Wizard</i> window as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt10.png\"><p><b>Step 9.</b> Click “Next”.</p><h3>2.3 How to Create a Standard Volume on a USB Memory Stick</h3><p>To create a TrueCrypt <i>Standard Volume</i> on a USB memory stick, perform steps 1 to 7 in section 2.2 How to Create a Standard Volume, where you activate the <i>Select a TrueCrypt Volume</i> screen. Instead of choosing <i>My Documents</i> as your file location, navigate to and then <b>choose</b> your USB memory stick. Then, <b>enter</b> a file name and create the <i>Standard Volume</i> there.</p><h3>2.4 How to Create a Standard Volume (continued)</h3><p>At this stage, you are ready to choose a specific encryption method (or <i>algorithm</i> as it is referred to on the screen) to encode the data that will be stored in your <i>Standard Volume</i>.</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt11.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> You may leave the default options here as they appear. All algorithms presented in the two options here are considered secure.</p><p><b>Step 10.</b> Click “Next” to activate the <i>TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard</i> screen as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt12.png\"><p>The <i>Volume Size</i> pane lets you specify the size of the <i>Standard Volume</i>. In this example, it is set at 10 megabytes. However, you may specify a different size. Consider the size of the documents and file types you would like to store, and then set an appropriate volume size for them.</p><p><b>Tip:</b> If you would like to backup your Standard Volume to a CD later on, then you should set the size to 700MB or less.</p><p><b>Step 11.</b> Type in your specific volume size into the text field, and then click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt13.png\"><p><b>Important:</b> Choosing a secure and strong password is among the most important tasks you will perform when creating a <i>Standard Volume</i>. A good password will protect your encrypted volume, and the stronger the password you choose, the better. You don't have to create your own passwords, or even remember them, if you use a password generation program like KeePass. Please refer to the <b><a href=\"umbrella://lesonn/keepassx\">KeePass lesson</a></b>, to learn more information about password creation and storage.</p><p><b>Step 12.</b> Type your password and then re-type your password into the <i>Confirm</i> text fields.</p><p><b>Important:</b> The <i>Next</i> button will remain disabled until passwords in both text fields match. If your password is not particularly safe or secure, you will see a warning advising you of this. Consider changing it! Although <b>TrueCrypt</b> will still work with any password you have chosen, your data may not be very secure.</p><p><b>Step 13.</b> Click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt14.png\"><p>TrueCrypt is now ready to create a <i>Standard Volume</i>. Move your mouse randomly within the <i>TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard</i> window for few seconds. The longer you move the mouse, the better the quality of the encryption key.</p><p><b>Step 14.</b> Click “Format” to begin creating your standard volume.</p><p>TrueCrypt will now create a file named <i>My Volume</i> in the <i>My Documents</i> folder as earlier specified. This file will contain a TrueCrypt <i>Standard Volume</i>, 10 Megabytes in size, that you can use to securely store your files.</p><p>After a <i>Standard Volume</i> has been successfully created, the following dialog box will appear:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt15.png\"><p><b>Step 15.</b> Click “OK” to complete creating your <i>Standard Volume</i> and return to the TrueCrypt console.</p><p><b>Step 16.</b> Click “Exit” to close <i>TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard</i>.</p><h3>3 How to Mount the Standard Volume</h3><h3>3.0 How to Mount a Standard Volume</h3><p>In TrueCrypt, to mount a <i>Standard Volume</i> refers to making the standard volume available for use. In this section, you will learn how to mount your newly created standard volume.</p><p>To begin mounting your standard volume, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Double click on the TrueCrypt icon or <b>Select Start > Programs > TrueCrypt > TrueCrypt</b> to open TrueCrypt.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select any drive from the list as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt16.png\"><p><i>In this example the Standard Volume will be mounted as the M: drive.</i></p><p><b>Note:</b> In the image above, the <i>M:</i> drive has been selected for mounting the <i>standard volume</i>; however, you may choose another listed drive.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Select File…”</p><p><i>The Select a TrueCrypt Volume screen will appear as follows:</i></p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt17.png\"><p><b>Step 4.</b> Select the standard volume file that you created, then click “Open” to close <i>figure 2</i> and return to the TrueCrypt console.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Mount” to activate the <i>Enter password for</i> prompt screen as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt18.png\"><p><b>Step 6.</b> Type the password in the <i>Password:</i> text field.</p><p><b>Step 7.</b> Click “OK” to begin mounting the <i>Standard Volume</i>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If the password you typed is incorrect, TrueCrypt will prompt you to re-type your password and click “OK”. If the password is correct, the <i>Standard Volume</i> will be mounted as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt19.png\"><p><b>Step 8.</b> Double click the highlighted entry in TrueCrypt or double click the corresponding drive letter in the <i>My Computer</i> screen to access the <i>Standard Volume</i> (now mounted on drive <i>M:</i> on your computer).</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt20.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> We have just successfully mounted the <i>My Volume</i> standard volume on a virtual disk <i>M:</i>. This virtual disk behaves like a real disk, except that it is entirely encrypted. Any files will be automatically encrypted when you copy, move or save them to this virtual disk (a process known as on-the-fly encryption).</p><p>You can copy files to and from the <i>Standard Volume</i> just as you would copy them to any normal disk (for example, by dragging-and-dropping them). When you move a file out of the <i>Standard Volume</i>, it is automatically decrypted. Conversely if you move a file onto the <i>Standard Volume</i>, TrueCrypt automatically encrypts it. If your computer crashes or is suddenly switched off, TrueCrypt will immediately close the <i>Standard Volume</i>.</p><p><b>Important:</b> After transferring files to the TrueCrypt volume, make sure that no traces of the files are left behind on the computer or USB memory stick that they came from. Please refer to the <b><a href=\"umbrella://lesson/safely-deleting\">Safe Deleting lesson</a></b>.</p><h3>3.1 How to Dismount the Standard Volume</h3><p>In TrueCrypt, to <i>dismount</i> a <i>Standard Volume</i> simply means to make a volume unavailable for use.</p><p>To close or dismount a <i>Standard Volume</i> and make its files accessible only to someone with a password, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select the volume from the list of mounted volumes in the main TrueCrypt window as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt21.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Dismount” to dismount or close your TrueCrypt standard volume.</p><p><b>Important:</b> Make sure to dismount your TrueCrypt volume before putting your computer to <i>Standby</i> or <i>Hibernate</i> mode. Better yet, always shut-down your computer or laptop if you plan on leaving it unattended. This will prevent anyone from being able to gain your volume password.</p><p>To retrieve a file stored in your standard volume once you have closed or dismounted it, you will have to mount it again.</p><h3>4.0 How to Back up your Volume</h3><p>Backing up your documents, files and folders on a regular basis is critical. Backing up your TrueCrypt volume is vital, and (fortunately) easy to do. Don't forget that your volume must be dismounted before you back it up.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Navigate to your <i>Standard Volume</i> file (in the image below, it is located in the <i>My Documents</i> folder).</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt22.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Save the file to an external memory device, like a CD, DVD or a USB memory stick.</p><p><b>Tip:</b> If you have large amounts of data that you want to encrypt and archive repeatedly, why not create a new <i>Standard Volume</i> which is the same size as a CD or DVD? This could be used as a secure storage technique.</p><p>Before you back up the standard volume to a removable device, make sure that the device size corresponds to the size of your volume.</p><h3>5.0 About Hidden Volumes</h3><p>In TrueCrypt, a <i>Hidden Volume</i> is stored within your encrypted <i>Standard Volume</i>, but its existence is concealed. Even when you 'mount' or open your standard volume, it is not possible either to find or to prove the existence of the hidden volume. If you are forced to reveal your password and the location of your standard volume, then its content may be revealed, but <b>not</b> the existence of the hidden volume within.</p><p>Imagine a briefcase with a secret compartment. You keep files that you do not mind having confiscated or losing in the normal section of your briefcase, and you keep the important and private files in the secret compartment. The point of the secret compartment (especially a well-designed one), is to hide its own existence and therefore, the documents within it.</p><h3>5.1 How to a Create a Hidden Volume</h3><p>The creation of a TrueCrypt <i>Hidden Volume</i> is similar to creating a TrueCrypt <i>Standard Volume</i>: Some of the panes, screens and windows are even the same.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Open TrueCrypt.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Create Volume” to activate the <i>TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard</i>.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Next” to accept the default <i>Create an encrypted file container</i> option.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Check the <i>Hidden TrueCrypt</i> volume option as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt23.png\"><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt24.png\"><p>• <i>Direct mode</i>: This option lets you create the <i>Hidden Volume</i> within an existing <i>Standard Volume</i>.<br>• Normal mode: This option lets you create a completely new <i>Standard Volume</i> in which to store the <i>Hidden Volume</i>.</p><p>In this example, we will use the <i>Direct mode</i>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you would rather start a new <i>Standard Volume</i>, please repeat the process from section 2.2 How to Create a Standard Volume.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Check the <i>Direct Mode</i> option and then click “Next” to activate the <i>TrueCrypt Volume Creation - Volume Location</i> window.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Make sure the <i>Standard Volume</i> is unmounted before selecting it.</p><p><b>Step 7.</b> Click “Select File” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt25.png\"><p><b>Step 8.</b> Locate the volume file using the <i>Select a TrueCrypt Volume</i> window as shown above.</p><p><b>Step 9.</b> Click “Open” to return to the <i>TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard</i>.</p><p><b>Step 10.</b> Click “Next” to activate the <i>Enter password</i> screen.</p><p><b>Step 11.</b> Type in password you used when creating the <i>Standard Volume</i> into the <i>Password</i> text field to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt26.png\"><p><b>Step 12.</b> Click “Next” after you have read the message to activate the <i>Hidden Volume Encryptions Options</i> screen.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Leave both the default <i>Encryption Algorithm</i> and <i>Hash Algorithm</i> settings for the Hidden Volume as they are.</p><p><b>Step 13.</b> Click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt27.png\"><p>You will be prompted to specify the size of the <i>Hidden Volume</i>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Consider the kind of documents, their quantity and size that need to be stored. Do leave some space for the <i>Standard Volume</i>. If you select the maximum size available for the <i>Hidden Volume</i>, you will not be able to put any more new files into the original <i>Standard Volume</i>.</p><p>If your <i>Standard Volume</i> is 10 Megabytes(MB) in size and you specify a <i>Hidden Volume</i> size of 5MB (as shown in <i>figure 6</i> above), you will have two volumes (one hidden and one standard volume) of approximately 5MB each.</p><p>Ensure that the information you store in the <i>Standard Volume</i> does not exceed the 5MB you have set. This is because the TrueCrypt program itself does not automatically detect the existence of the <i>Hidden Volume</i>, and it could accidentally overwrite it. You may risk losing all files stored in the hidden volume if you exceed your previously established size.</p><p><b>Step 14.</b> Type in the desired hidden volume size into the corresponding text box as shown in the image below.</p><p><b>Step 15.</b> Click “Next” to activate the <i>Hidden Volume Password</i> window.</p><p>You must now create a <i>different</i> password for the hidden volume from the one used to protect your standard volume. Again, remember to choose a strong password. Please refer to the <b><a href=\"umbrella://lesson/keepassx\">KeePass Tool Guide</a></b> to learn more about creating strong passwords.</p><p><b>Tip:</b> If you anticipate being forced to reveal the contents of your TrueCrypt volumes, then store your password for the standard volume in KeePass, and create a strong password that you only have to remember for hidden volume. This will help you to conceal your hidden volume, as you will not leave any trace of its existence.</p><p><b>Step 16.</b> Create a password and type it in twice, and then click “Next” to activate the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt28.png\"><P>Leave the default <i>File System</i> and <i>Cluster</i> options as they are.</p><p><b>Step 17.</b> Move the mouse cursor around the screen to increase the cryptographic strength of the encryption and then click “Format” to format the hidden volume.</p><p><i>After the hidden volume has been formatted, the following screen appears:</i></p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt29.png\"><p><b>Note:</b> <i>Figure 8</i> both confirms that you have successfully created a hidden volume, as well as warning you against the dangers of overwriting files in the hidden volume when storing files in the standard volume.</p><p><b>Step 18.</b> Click “OK” to activate the <i>Hidden Volume Created</i> window, and then click “Exit” and return to the TrueCrypt console.</p><p>The hidden volume has now been created inside your standard volume. You may now store documents in the hidden volume, which remain invisible even to someone who has obtained the password for that particular standard volume.</p><h3>5.2 How to Mount the Hidden Volume</h3><p>The method for mounting or making a <i>Hidden Volume</i> accessible for use is exactly the same as that for a <i>Standard Volume</i>; the only difference is you will use the password that you have just created for the <i>Hidden Volume</i>.</p><p>To <i>mount</i> or open the <i>Hidden Volume</i>, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select a drive from the list (in this example, drive <i>K</i>):</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt30.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Select File…” to activate the <i>Select a TrueCrypt Volume</i> window.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Navigate to and then select your <i>TrueCrypt</i> volume file (same file as for the standard volume).</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Click “Open” to return to the TrueCrypt console.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Mount” to activate the <i>Enter Password</i> for prompt screen as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt31.png\"><p><b>Step 6.</b> Type the password you used to create the hidden volume, and then click “OK”.</p><p>Your hidden volume is now mounted (or opened) as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt32.png\"><p><b>Step 7.</b> Double click on above entry or access it through the <i>My Computer</i> window.</p><h3>5.3 Tips on How to Use the Hidden Disk Feature Securely</h3><p>The purpose of the hidden disk feature is to escape a potentially dangerous situation by <i>appearing</i> to hand over your encrypted files, when someone in a position of power demands to see them, without actually being forced to reveal your most sensitive information. In addition to protecting your data, this may allow you to avoid further jeopardizing your own safety or exposing your colleagues and partners. For this technique to be effective, you must create a situation where the person demanding to see your files will be satisfied by what you show them and let you go.</p><p>To do this, you may want to implement some of the following suggestions:</p><p>• Put some confidential documents that you do not mind having exposed in the standard volume. This information must be sensitive enough that it would make sense for you to keep it in an encrypted volume.<br>• Be aware that someone demanding to see your files may know about hidden volumes. If you are using TrueCrypt correctly, however, this person will not be able to prove that your hidden volume exists, which will make your denial more believable.<br>• Update the files in the standard volume on a weekly basis. This will create the impression that you really are using those files.</p><p>Whenever you mount a TrueCrypt volume, you can choose enable the <i>Protect hidden volume against damage caused by writing to outer volume</i> feature. A very important feature, it lets you add new 'decoy' files to your standard volume without the risk of you accidentally deleting or overwriting the encrypted contents of your hidden volume.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, exceeding the storage limit on your standard volume may otherwise destroy your hidden files. Do not enable the <i>Protect hidden volume</i> feature when forced to mount a TrueCrypt volume, because doing so requires you to enter the secret password to your hidden volume and will clearly reveal that volume's existence. When you are updating your decoy files in private, however, you should <i>always</i> enable this option.</p><p>To use the <i>Protect hidden volume</i> feature, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click “Mount Options…” on the <i>Enter Password</i> prompt shown in the image above. This will activate the <i>Mount Options</i> window as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt33.png\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Check the <i>Protect hidden volume against damage caused by writing to outer volume</i> option.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Type in in your Hidden Volume password, and then click “OK”.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Click “Mount” to mount your standard volume. After you have successfully mounted it, you will be able to add decoy files without damaging your hidden volume.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Dismount” to dismount, or your make your standard volume unavailable for use, when you have finished modifying its contents.</p><p><b>Remember:</b> You only need to do this when you are updating the files in your standard volume. If forced to reveal your standard volume to someone else, you should not use the <i>Protect hidden volume</i> feature.</p><h3>6. Portable TrueCrypt</h3><img src=\"tool_truecrypt34.png\"><p>Truecrypt keeps your files secure by preventing anyone without the correct password from opening your hidden documents and files. It works like an electronic safe, which you can use to securely lock up your files.</p><h3>6.1 Differences between the Installed and Portable versions of TrueCrypt</h3><p>Given that portable tools are not installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses.</p><p>As with many of the portable software tools documented here, Portable TrueCrypt allows you to use a powerful and simple file encryption tool without being detected. Having Portable TrueCrypt on removable device or USB memory stick lets you use it from different workstations.</p><p>There are very few differences between both the installed and portable versions of Portable TrueCrypt, the main one being that Portable TrueCrypt does not permit the encryption of the entire disk or system disk.</p><h3>6.2 Downloading, Extracting and Using Portable TrueCrypt</h3><p><b>Note:</b> The folder into which Portable TrueCrypt is to be extracted must be created manually on the removable device, USB memory stick or computer disk before the extraction process.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Navigate to chosen destination where you would like to extract the Portable TrueCrypt program to, and then right-click to activate its associated menu.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select the <i>New item</i> to activate its sub-folder, and then select the <i>Folder</i> sub-menu item, as shown below:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt35.png\"><p><b>Step 3.</b> Enter the name of the folder.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You may give this folder a less obvious name to conceal the existence of the Portable TrueCrypt program.</p><p>Portable TrueCrypt can be extracted from the same archive as installation version:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Navigate to TrueCrypt installation file on your computer.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Double click <i>TrueCryptSetup7.1.a.exe</i>; the <i>Open File - Security Warning</i> dialog box may appear; if it does, click “Yes” to activate the TrueCrypt installation wizard.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Check the Extract option to extract TrueCrypt portable to a removable drive or USB device as shown below:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt36.png\"><p><b>Step 6.</b> Click “Next” to activate following two screens:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt37.png\"><img src=\"tool_truecrypt38.png\"><p> <b>Click</b> “OK” and “Yes” respectively to activate the <b>Extraction Options</b> window as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt39.png\"><p><b>Step 7.</b> Click “Browse” to activate the <i>Browse for Folders</i> window as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt40.png\"><p><b>Step 8.</b> Navigate to your destination folder on either the external drive or USB memory stick, and then click “OK”, to return the <i>Extraction Options</i> window as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt41.png\"><p><b>Step 9.</b> Click “Extract” to begin extracting TrueCrypt to your removable drive or USB memory stick; a few seconds later, the following windows will appear:</p><img src=\"tool_truecrypt42.png\"><p><b>Step 10.</b> Click “OK” and then click “Finish” to complete the installation process.</p><p><i>If the “Open the destination location when fininshed” option was enabled (as it usually is by default), the following screen will appear:</i></p><p><b>Step 11.</b> Navigate to and then double click <i>TrueCrypt.exe</i> to run Portable TrueCrypt.</p><p>Please refer to the instructions for regular TrueCrypt above from this point onwards, for more on how to use TrueCrypt.</p><h3>6.3 How to Eliminate All Traces of Having Extracted Portable TrueCrypt</h3><p><b>Important:</b> After you have successfully extracted Portable TrueCrypt to your external/removable device, you must delete the installation file from your computer to further eliminate any traces of you having downloaded and installed Portable TrueCrypt.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Navigate to the folder in which Portable TrueCrypt was downloaded, and then right click the <i>TrueCryptSetup7.1.a.exe</i> installation file to activate the Windows pop-up menu; then, select the “Delete” command to move it to your Recycle Bin.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Double click the Recycle Bin to open its associated window, and then select and delete the file.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you have either CCleaner or Eraser installed, you can use either of them to eliminate all traces of your having ever downloaded and installed Portable TrueCrypt.
