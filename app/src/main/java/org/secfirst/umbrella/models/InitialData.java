This means that only those people who really need that piece of information to operate should be given it. For example, if a team is working with a high-risk source, only the source’s direct contact within the team should have his or her real name and details – the rest of the team can operate using a code name. This reduces the risk for both the source and those other members of the team.</p><img src=\"managing_information1\"><p>If there is not a good reason to keep a piece of sensitive information then you should simply delete it (see the Safely Deleting lesson).</p><h1>Threat Modelling</h1><p>There is no single solution for keeping your information safe. Managing your information securely isn’t about which tools you use; it’s about understanding the threats you face and how you can counter those threats. To become more secure, you should figure out what you need to protect, and whom you need to protect it from. Threats can change depending on where you’re located, what you’re doing, and whom you’re working with. The easiest way to figure out what solutions are best for you is to carry out a threat modelling assessment.</p><img src=\"managing_information2\"><p>When carrying out an assessment, there are five main questions you should ask yourself:</p><h2>1. What do you want to protect?</h2><p>What information could put you, your work or others at risk if were public? This is often the kind of information kept in your emails, contact lists, messages and files. It might relate to a specific sensitive campaign you are working on.</p><h2>2. Who do you want to protect it from?</h2><p>This could be any person or entity that poses a threat against an your or your work, also known as an adversary. Think about who would have a motive in reading or deleting your information or disrupting your work. Examples could be a government, a company you are exposing, your boss, or a hacker.</p><h2>3. How likely is it that you will need to protect it?</h2><p>It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur. Calculating risk means figuring out the chance that a threat might actually occur – how likely is it that a threat would be carried out? You also need to think about the capability of potential attackers. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all of your phone records and therefore has the capability to use or share that data. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. A government might have stronger capabilities.</p><h2>4. How bad are the consequences if you fail?</h2><p>The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A company trying to prevent the spread of a video showing their illegal activity may simply want to delete the video, whereas a government may wish to gain access to the names/details of activists it sees as a threat to the state in order to arrest or harass them.</p><h2>5. How much trouble are you willing to go through in order to try to prevent those?</h2><p>This means figuring out which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Information Security<br>· Communications Security<br>· Network Security</p><h3>FURTHER READING</h3><p>· https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/introduction-threat-modeling<br>· Citizen Lab  - https://citizenlab.org<br>· Crypto Law Survey - http://www.cryptolaw.org<br>· OpenNet (Outlines internet restrictions) - https://opennet.net<br>· https://prism-break.org/en/<br>· DLA Piper (Data Protection Laws of the World) - http://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com</p>"));

It can do things like gather information, impersonate a user, gain access to other computers, or stop a computer from working. It could do this by allowing an attacker to record from a webcam and microphone, disabling anti-virus programs, recording keystrokes, copying emails and other documents, stealing passwords, and more. Most malware is criminal and is often used to obtain banking information or other valuable information. However, it is also used by governments, law enforcement agencies, and even private citizens to spy on users.</p><img src=\"malware1\"><h1>Anti-virus software</h1><p>You should always use anti-virus software on your computer and your smartphone, which are easily available to buy and download. Avast is an easy to use anti-virus program for Windows. Clam Win is a good open source alternative.  Anti-virus software can be quite effective at combatting cheap, “non targeted” malware that might be used by criminals against hundreds of targets. However such software is usually ineffective against targeted attacks, such as ones carried out by governments against.</p><h1>How can I tell if my computer is compromised?</h1><p>Malware is very difficult to detect. Scanners such as Spybot or Malwarebytes can detect and protect against some malware threats and are useful to use.<br>While most malware avoids detection by software, it is still sometimes possible to find indicators of it on your computer. For example, services will sometimes send you a warning email if they believe your account has been targeted, you may notice a light indicating that your webcam is turned on when you have not activated it yourself, or your settings have been altered to send copies of your emails to an unfamiliar email address.</p><img src=\"malware2\"><h1>How can attackers use malware to target me?</h1><p>The most common method of attack is to trick you into installing the malware yourself. There are many ways they try to do this.<br>· They may disguise the malware as a link to a website, a document, a software update, or even a program designed to help secure your computer.<br>· You may be targeted via email (which may look as if it’s coming from someone you know), via a message on Skype or Twitter, or even via a link posted to your Facebook page.<br>You can also infect your computer by connecting infected hardware, like a USB key given to you or found near your office, or a phone connected to charge.</p><img src=\"malware3\"><p>The more targeted the attack the more they’ll try to make it look like something you want to open. For example, in Syria, pro-Assad hackers targeted members of the opposition with malware hidden in fake revolutionary documents and a fake anti-hacking tool. And in Morocco, activists were targeted with malware hidden in a document made to look as if it had been sent by an Al-Jazeera reporter, promising information about a political scandal.</p><p>There is also the possibility of someone gaining physical access to your computer to install malware themselves. You can read more about preventing against such attacks in the Organisational Security – Office section.</p><h1>How can I avoid getting infected?</h1><p>· Always make sure you are running the latest version of your software and downloading the latest security patches. Only the latest updates have the latest protections. It is a common belief that if you are running an unregistered copy of Windows, you cannot or should not accept security updates. This is not true. Always update. Secunia PSI for Windows is a free tool that will check to make sure your software is up to date.<br>· Only download software from official sites.<br>· Avoid open opening suspicious attachments (anything from someone you don’t know) or clicking on suspicious links (any links you didn’t request)<br>· If you are using Gmail, open unusual attachments in Google Drive rather than downloading them.<br>· Double check the sender’s email address if you get an email with an attachment or link you weren’t expecting, even if the email appears to be written by a friend or colleague. If something seems odd or their tone is unusual, it doesn’t hurt to email the friend to check they sent it and mention it to colleagues.<br>· Stay alert when browsing websites. Watch for browser windows that appear automatically, and read them carefully. When in doubt, you should close 'pop up windows' by clicking the X in the upper corner, rather than by clicking Cancel.<br>· Disconnect your computer from the Internet when you are not using it and shut it down completely overnight</p><img src=\"malware4\"><h1>What should I do if I find malware on my computer?</h1><p>-The first thing you should do if you find malware on your computer is unplug your computer from the Internet and stop using it immediately. Every keystroke you make may be being sent to an attacker.<br>· Log into a computer you believe is safe and change your passwords; every password that you typed on your computer while it was infected should now be considered to be compromised.<br>· You may wish to reinstall the operating system (eg Windows, Android, IOS) on your computer in order to remove the malware. This will remove most malware, but some especially sophisticated malware may persist.<br>· If you can, take your computer to a security expert, who may be able to discover more details about the malware.<br>· If you have some idea of when your computer was infected, you may reinstall files from before that date. Reinstalling files from after the date of infection may re-infect your computer.</p><img src=\"malware5\">"));

There are a few ways in which you can make sure you get the most out of your software.</p><img src=\"malware_adv1\"><p>· Do not run two anti-virus programs at the same time, as this might cause your computer to run extremely slowly or to crash. Uninstall one before installing another. However anti-malware software is designed to work alongside anti-virus software.<br>· Make sure that your anti-virus program updates itself regularly. Without updates it can quickly become ineffective. All of the software recommended here supports free updating.<br>· Enable your anti-virus software's 'always on' virus-detection feature if it has one. It may also be called 'Realtime Protection,' 'Resident Protection,' or something similar.<br>· Scan all of the files on your computer regularly. You don't have to do this every day but you should do it from time to time. How often may depend on the circumstances. Have you connected your computer to unknown networks recently? With whom have you been sharing USB memory sticks? Do you frequently receive strange attachments by email? Has someone else in your home or office recently had virus problems? Tools such as Avast can do this for you.</p><h1>Preventing virus or spyware infection</h1><p>· If you need to open a file from someone you don’t know well, you should save the attachment to a folder on your computer, then open the appropriate application (such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat) yourself. If you use the program's File menu to open the attachment manually, rather than double-clicking the file or allowing your email program to open it automatically, you are less likely to contract a virus.<br>· Hover over URLs and hyperlinks to check where they lead. If you're unsure about a URL, check it at VirusTotal.<br>· Before inserting removable media, such as CDs or USB sticks, into your computer, you should disable your operating system's 'AutoPlay' feature. (This is usually found under the Properties section of My Computer)<br>· Improve the security of your Web browser by preventing it from automatically running the potentially dangerous programs that are sometimes contained within webpages you visit. If you are using Mozilla Firefox, you can install the NoScript add-on.<br>· Download over an encrypted connection (usually SSL in the browser) whenever possible.<br>· Using free and open-source software significantly lowers your risk of being infected by malware. These tools are often written and updated for free by volunteers and are generally more secure than their proprietary alternatives. In particular, you should consider replacing Internet Explorer, Outlook and Microsoft Office with Firefox, Thunderbird and LibreOffice, respectively. You should also consider switching from the Microsoft Windows operating system to a more secure open-source alternative like Ubuntu or ChromeOS.</p><img src=\"malware_adv2\"><h1>Preventing untrusted network connections</h1><p>· A firewall helps to protect your computer from unauthorised connections to and from the Internet. It can also help reduce the spread of malware if you are infected.  Most operating systems have firewalls included but check to make sure they are turned on. (You can usually find this under Control Panel > Security) There are also excellent free programs such as Comodo Personal Firewall, which can help keep your computer secure.<br>· Make sure that all of the computers on your office network have a firewall installed. Read more about this in the Network Section.<br>· Only install essential programs on the computer you use for sensitive work, and make sure you get them from a reputable source. Uninstall any software that you do not use.</p><img src=\"malware_adv3\">"));
        segmentList.add(new Segment(5, 1, "<p>Passwords are often the first and only barrier between your information and anyone who might want to read, use or destroy it without your permission.</p><p>In general, when you want to protect something - whether a house or an email account - you lock it up with a key. All keys, physical and electronic, have one thing in common: they open their locks just as effectively in the hands of somebody else. You can use the most advanced security tools, but if your password is weak, or if you allow it to fall into the wrong hands, they will not do you any good.</p><img src=\"password1\"><h1>How to make a strong password</h1><p>A password should be difficult for a computer program to guess, difficult for others to figure out, and should be chosen so as to minimise damage if someone does learn it.</p><p>· Make it long: The longer a password is, the longer takes to guess it. Use more than ten characters or ideally a long phrase or sentence. Short passwords of any kind, even totally random ones, are not strong enough for use with encryption today.<br>· Make it complex: Include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols.<br>· Don't make it personal: Don't choose a word or phrase based on information such as your name, telephone number, child's name, pet's name, birth date, or anything else that a person could learn by doing a little research about you.<br>· Keep it secret: Do not share your password with anyone unless it is absolutely necessary. If you must share a password with a family member or colleague, you should change it to a temporary password first, share that one, then change it back when they are done using it. Often, there are alternatives to sharing a password, such as creating a separate account for each individual who needs access. Keeping your password secret also means not allowing anyone to see you typing it in.<br>· Make it unique: Avoid using the same password for more than one account. Otherwise, anyone who learns that password will gain access to even more of your sensitive information.<br>· Keep it fresh: Change your password on a regular basis, at least once every three months. The longer you keep one password, the more opportunity others have to figure it out and use it.<br>· Make it memorable: If you have to write your password down because you can't remember it, you may end up facing a whole new category of threats that could leave you vulnerable to anybody with access to your work area. If you are unable to think of a password that is long and complex but still memorable, the remembering secure passwords section, below, might be of some help. If not, you should still choose something secure, but you may need to record it using a secure password database such as KeePass, outlined in our Advanced section. Other types of password-protected files, including Microsoft Word documents, should not be trusted for this purpose, as many of them can be broken in seconds using tools that are freely available on the internet.</p><img src=\"password2\"><h1>Remembering secure passwords</h1><p>There are a few tricks that might help you create passwords that are easy to remember but very difficult to guess.</p><p>-Vary capitalisation, such as: 'My naME is Not MR. MarSter'<br>· Alter numbers and letters, such as: 'a11 w0Rk 4nD N0 p14Y'<br>· Incorporate symbols, such as: 'c@t(heR1nthery3'<br>· Use multiple languages, such as: 'Let Them Eat 1e gateaU au ch()colaT'<br>· Use acronyms: 'Are you happy today?' becomes 'rU:-)2d@y?'</p><p>A little effort to make the password more complex goes a very long way. Increasing the length of a password even just by a few characters, or by adding numbers or special characters, makes it much more difficult to crack.</p><p>You can check the strength of passwords on Passfault.</p><h1>Security Questions</h1><p>Be aware of the “security questions” (such as “What is your mother’s maiden name?” or \"What was your first pet's name?\") that websites use to confirm your identity if you do forget your password. Honest answers to many security questions are publicly discoverable facts that a can be easily found, and therefore bypass your password entirely. Instead, give fictional answers that, like your password, no one knows but you. For example, if the password question asks you your pet’s name, you may have posted photos to photo sharing sites with captions such as “Here is a photo of my cute cat, Spot!” Instead of using “Spot” as your password recovery answer, you might choose “Rumplestiltskin.”</p>"));
        segmentList.add(new Segment(5, 2, "<h1>Recording passwords securely</h1><p>Our Basic section showed you how to create a strong, memorable password. However, because you need a different password for every account or service and also need to change them every few months, it can soon become difficult to remember them all. Fortunately, there are software tools to help with this – a password manager is a software application that can generate random, secure passwords for each of your accounts and record them in a portable, encrypted password database, such as KeePass.</p><img src=\"password_adv1\"><p>The password manager protects all of your passwords with a single master password so you only have to remember one thing. Of course, if you use this method, it becomes especially important that you create and remember a very secure password for KeePass, or whatever tool you choose. Whenever you need to enter a password for a specific account, you can look it up using only your master password, which makes it much easier to follow all of the suggestions above.</p><p>KeePass sits on your desktop, and it also portable, which means that you can put the database on a USB memory stick in case you need to look up a password while you are away from your primary computer.</p><p>There are few things to keep in mind when using password databases.</p><p>· If you lose or accidentally delete your only copy of a password database, you will no longer have access to any of the accounts for which it contained passwords. This makes it extremely important that you back up your KeePass database. Read our Backing Up lesson for instructions on how to do this.<br>· If you forget your KeePass master password, there is no way to recover it or the contents of the database. So, be sure to choose a master password that is both secure and memorable!</p><p>It is also crucially important to keep your password manager itself secure.</p><p>· Some password managers will offer to store your passwords “in the cloud,” which is to say, they will store your passwords encrypted on a remote server, and when you need them on a laptop or mobile, they will retrieve and decrypt them for you automatically. Password managers like this are more convenient, but the trade-off is that they are more vulnerable to attack. If you just keep your passwords on your computer, then someone who can take over your computer may be able to get hold of them. If you keep them in the cloud, your attacker may target that also. It's not usually a compromise you need to worry about unless your attacker has legal powers over the password manager company or is known for targeting companies or internet traffic.<br>· When you use a password manager, the security of your passwords and your master password is only as strong as the security of the computer where the password manager is installed and used. If your computer or device is compromised and spyware is installed, the spyware can watch you type your master password and could steal the contents of the password safe. So it's still very important to keep your computer and other devices clean of malicious software when using a password manager. You can learn more about this in the Malware lesson.</p>  <h1>Two-step authentication and one-time passwords</h1><p>Many services and software tools let you use two-step authentication. Here the idea is that in order to log in, you need to be in possession of a certain physical object: usually a mobile phone, but, in some versions, a special device called a security token. Using two-step authentication ensures that even if your password for the service is hacked or stolen, the thief won't be able to log in unless they also have control of a second device, such as your phone, and the special codes that only it can create.</p><img src=\"password_adv2\"><p>Two-step authentication using a mobile phone can be done in two ways: the service can send you an SMS text message to your phone whenever you try to log in which provides an extra security code that you need to type in. Alternatively, your phone can run an authenticator application, such as Google Authenticator, that generates security codes from inside the phone itself. This will help protect your account in situations where an attacker has your password but does not have physical access to your mobile phone.</p><p>Some services, such as Google, also allow you to generate a list of one-time passwords, also called single-use passwords. These are meant to be printed or written down on paper and carried with you.</p><p>There is no way to do this by yourself if you're using a service that doesn't offer it.</p><p>If you or your organization runs your own communications infrastructure, such as your own e-mail servers, there's freely available software that can be used to enable two-step authentication for accessing your systems. Ask your systems administrators to look for software offering an implementations of the open standard “Time-Based One-Time Passwords” or RFC 6238.

If you fear this may be a possibility, such as if you are going to be travelling across hostile borders with sensitive information, consider ways in which you can hide the existence of the data or device you are password-protecting, rather than trust that you will never hand over the password. One possibility is to maintain at least one computer/email/keepass account that contains largely unimportant information, whose password you can reveal quickly.</p><p>If you have good reason to believe that someone may threaten you for your passwords, it's good to make sure your devices are configured so that it won't be obvious that the account you are revealing is not the “real” one.

The Managing Information lesson can help you determine your threat model. Following the steps laid out in the Home/Office section and the Malware lesson will help you to protect your computer physically and digitally. However there may be situations where these precautions fail or you need to show your computer to someone whom you don’t want to see the files. This is why you should also protect the files themselves. You can do this by encrypting them so that only you can read them.</p><img src=\"protecting1\"><p>Encryption is a way to enhance the security of a message or file by scrambling the contents so that it can only be read by someone who has the right encryption key to unscramble it.<br>There is a good, free, open-source tool that can help you do this, called TrueCrypt. Much like a safe, TrueCrypt creates an encrypted container on your computer or hard drive, that you can put as many files as you like into.</p><p>Learn how to set-up and use TrueCrypt here.</p><h1>Tips on using file encryption safely</h1><p>There are a few things you should bear in mind when using TrueCrypt and tools like it. No matter how sturdy your safe is, it won't do you a whole lot of good if you leave the door open. When your TrueCrypt volume or container is 'mounted' (what it calls open to view your files), your data may be vulnerable, so you should keep it closed except when you are actually reading or modifying the files inside it.</p><p>There are a few situations when it is especially important that you remember to ‘dismount’ (what it calls close) your encrypted volume:<br>· Dismount it when you walk away from your computer for any length of time. Even if you typically leave your computer running overnight, you need to ensure that you do not leave your sensitive files accessible to physical or remote intruders while you are gone.<br>· Dismount it before putting your computer to sleep.<br>· Dismount it before allowing someone else to handle your computer. When taking a laptop through a security checkpoint or border crossing, it is important that you disconnect all encrypted volumes and shut your computer down completely.<br>· Dismount it before inserting an untrusted USB memory stick or other external storage device, including those belonging to friends and colleagues.<br>· If you keep an encrypted volume on an external hard drive or a USB stick, remember that just removing the device may not immediately disconnect the volume. Even if you need to secure your files in a hurry, you have to dismount the volume properly, then disconnect the external drive or memory stick, then remove the device.</p><h1>A secret safe within a safe</h1><p>One of the weaknesses with some encryption tools is their visibility – you may be worried that someone could find the encrypted volume, see that you were trying to conceal information, and use intimidation, blackmail or interrogation to force you into opening it.</p><p>However TrueCrypt allows you to create a secret volume, inside your regular encrypted volume, to hide your most sensitive information. It is similar to installing a secret 'false bottom' inside your office safe. If an intruder steals your key, or intimidates you into giving them the safe's combination, they will find some convincing decoy material, but not the information that you truly care about protecting.</p><p>You open this secret volume by providing an alternate password that is different from the one you would normally use. Even if a technically sophisticated intruder gains access to the standard volume, he will be unable to prove that a hidden one exists.</p><h1>Hiding your encryption</h1><p>If you are concerned about encryption software being found on your computer regardless of what’s in it, there are a few tricks to help disguise TrueCrypt.</p><p>· You can rename your encrypted volume to look like a different type of file. Using the '.iso' file extension, to disguise it as a CD image, is one option that works well for large volumes of around 700 MB. Other extensions would be more realistic for smaller volumes.<br>· You can also rename the TrueCrypt program itself, assuming you have stored it as you would a regular file, rather than installing it as a program. The TrueCrypt Guide explains how to do this.</p><h1>When encryption is illegal</h1><p>Encryption is illegal in some countries, which means that downloading, installing or using software of this sort might be a crime in its own right. Any time that merely being associated with encryption software would be enough to expose you to accusations of criminal activity or espionage (regardless of what is actually inside your encrypted volumes), then you will have to think carefully about whether or not such tools are appropriate for your situation.</p><p>If that is the case, you have a few options:<br>· Store only non-confidential information<br>· Use a system of code words to protect key elements of your sensitive files<br>· Store all of your sensitive information in a secure webmail account – you would need a reliable network connection and an advanced understanding of computers and Internet services<br>· Keep sensitive information off of your computer by storing it on a USB stick or portable hard drive – carrying around sensitive, unencrypted information is usually a very bad idea so you would need to keep the device in a very secure place</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Managing Information Lesson<br>· Home/Office Section<br>· Malware Lesson<br>· TrueCrypt Tool Guide</p>"));

This means that, with the right tools, your “deleted” files can often be retrieved.</p><img src=\"deleting1\"><p>The best way to delete a file forever, then, is to make sure it gets overwritten immediately.<br>This can be done easily using Eraser (for Windows) or Secure Delete (for Mac OS X), both of which are described below.

The instructions below apply only to traditional disk drives. If you’re using an SSD or a USB flash drive, you can skip to the section about it below.</p><h1>Secure deletion on Windows</h1><p>On Windows, we suggest using Eraser. Eraser is a free/open source secure deletion tool for Windows, and is much better than the built-in tools. To use Eraser, first download the installer from its website; make sure to choose a “stable” build. After the file downloads, double-click on it to launch it and Run the file.</p><p>Once Eraser is installed, if you want to securely delete a single file or folder, simply:<br>· Right-click on the file or folder and choose Eraser > Erase from the right-click menu.</p><p>Alternatively, you may want to securely erase all the previously deleted data from your computer.<br>· Launch Eraser.<br>· Click the downward-pointing arrow next to “Erase Schedule” and choose “New Task.”<br>· In the “Task Properties” dialog that pops up, set the “Task Type” to “Run immediately.”<br>· Then click the “Add Data” button near the bottom of the dialog.<br>· In the new “Select Data to Erase” dialog that pops up, choose “Unused disk space” and make sure the correct disk drive is selected in the drop down box (most likely the “(C:)” drive).<br>· Click “OK” to exit both dialogs, and Eraser should start erasing.<br>· Once it’s done erasing, the task will disappear from the list of tasks in the “Erase Schedule.”</p><h1>Secure deletion on Mac OS X</h1><p>On OS X 10.4 and above, you can securely delete individual files by simply:<br>· Moving them to the Trash;<br>· Then selecting Finder > Secure Empty Trash.</p><p>Alternatively, you may want to securely erase all the previously deleted data from your computer. Apple's advice on this is to:<br>· Open Disk Utility (in Applications/Utilities);<br>· Choose Help > Disk Utility Help;<br>· Search for help on erasing free disk space.</p><h1>Limitations</h1><p>Unfortunately, there are limitations to secure deletion tools. Even if you follow the advice above and you’ve deleted all copies of a file, certain traces of deleted files, such as its name will probably continue to exist for some time on your computer. Overwriting the entire disk and installing a fresh operating system is the only way to be 100% certain that records of a file have been erased.</p><p>You may be wondering, \"Could I search the raw data on the disk to see if there are any copies of the data anywhere?\" The answer is yes and no. Searching the disk will tell you if the data is present in plaintext, but it won't tell you if some program has compressed or otherwise coded references to it. Also be careful that the search itself does not leave a record!</p><h1>Secure deletion when discarding old hardware</h1><p>If you want to finally throw a piece of hardware away or sell it on eBay, you'll want to make sure no one can retrieve your data from it. And even if you're not getting rid of it right away, if you have a computer that has reached the end of its life and is no longer in use, it's also safer to wipe the hard drive before stashing the machine in a corner or a closet. This can be done easily with a tool such as Darik's Boot and Nuke – our Tool Guide will run you through the steps.</p><h1>Discarding CD-ROMS</h1><p>When it comes to CD-ROMs, you should do the same thing you do with paper―shred them. There are inexpensive shredders that will chew up CD-ROMs. Never just throw a CD-ROM out in the rubbish unless you're absolutely sure there's nothing sensitive on it.</p><h1>Secure deletion on solid-state disks (SSDs), USB flash drives, and SD cards</h1><p>Unfortunately due to the way SSDs, USB flash drives, and SD cards work, it is difficult, if not impossible, to securely delete both individual files and free space. As a result your best bet in terms of protection is to use encryption—that way, even if the file is still on the disk, it will at least look like code to anyone who gets ahold of it and can’t force you to decrypt it. You can learn about how to use encryption in the Protecting Files lesson.</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Protecting Files</p>"));

Years of work can disappear in an instant as a result of theft, carelessness, confiscation, or breakage, so it is extremely important to have an up-to-date backup and a well-tested means of restoring it.</p><p>Creating an effective backup policy can be tricky for a few reasons:<br>· The need to store original data and backups in different physical locations;<br>· The importance of keeping backups confidential;<br>· The challenge of coordinating among different people who share information with one another using their own portable storage devices.</p><p>In addition to backup and file-recovery tactics, this lesson addresses two specific tools, Cobian Backup and Recuva.</p><h1>Identifying and organising your information</h1><p>The first step to formulating a backup policy is to figure out where all your personal and work information is currently located. This may include the following:<br>· Email may be stored on the provider's mail server, on your own computer, or both.<br>· Documents, address books, or chat histories on the computers you use, which may be in the office or at home.<br>· Information may also be stored on USB sticks, portable hard drives, or CDs.<br>· Contacts and important text messages on your mobile phone.<br>· Your website may contain important information or collection of work.<br>· Don't forget your non-digital information, such as paper notebooks, diaries and letters.</p><p>Next, you need to work out which of these files are 'master copies,' and which are duplicates. The master copy is generally the most up-to-date version of a file and is the one you will want to back-up.</p><p>You should make a table of all the information types you identified above and for each of them note:<br>· Whether that information is master copy or duplicate;<br>· The device or devices they are stored on;<br>· The physical location that the device is usually kept.</p><p>This table will help you see which of your information (or master copies) is only in one location and therefore vulnerable.</p><img src=\"backing1\"><h1>Your backup strategy</h1><p>To back up all of the data types listed above, you will need a combination of software and processes. Basically, you need to make sure that each data type is stored in at least two separate locations.</p><p>· <b>Electronic documents</b> - Create a full backup of the documents on your computer using a program like Cobian Backup, which is described in more detail below. Store the backup on something portable so that you can take it home or to some other safe location. External hard drives, CD/DVDs or USB memory sticks are possible choices. Because this category of data often contains the most sensitive information, it is important to protect your electronic document backups using encryption. You can learn how to do this in the Protecting Files lesson and in the TrueCrypt Guide.<br>· <b>Program databases</b> - If you use a calendar application or an electronic address book, for example, you will need to find the folder in which these programs store their data. Once you have determined the location of your program databases, you can back them up in the same way as electronic documents.<br>· <b>Email</b> - Rather than accessing your email only through a web browser, install an email client like Thunderbird and configure it to work with your account. The Thunderbird Guide explains in detail how to do this. Also most webmail services will provide instructions on how to use such programs and, often, how to import your email addresses into them. If you choose to move your old email messages to your computer so they are not stored on the server for security reasons, make sure that you include them in the backup of electronic documents described above.<br>· <b>Mobile phone contents</b> - To back up the phone numbers and text messages on your mobile phone, you can connect it to your computer using the appropriate software, which is generally available from the website of the company that manufactured your phone. You may need to buy a special USB cable to do this.<br>· <b>Printed documents</b> - Where possible, you should scan all of your important papers, then back them up along with your other electronic documents, as discussed above.</p><h1>Storage devices</h1><p> Before you can back up your data, you must decide what kind of storage device you will use.</p><p>· <b>USB sticks or external hard drives</b> – These are inexpensive, offer large capacity, and are easy to overwrite numerous times. USB sticks often have a lifetime of approximately ten years, with external hard drives lasting longer.<br>· <b>CDs</b> – CDs store around 700 Megabytes (MB) of data. You will need a CD burner and blank discs. If you want to erase a CD and update the files stored on it, you will need to have a CD-RW burner and rewritable CDs. All major operating systems, including Windows XP, now include built-in software that can write CDs and CD-RWs. These discs may begin to deteriorate after five or ten years.<br>· <b>DVDs</b> - DVDs store up to 4.7 Gigabytes (GB) of data. They work much like CDs but require slightly more expensive DVD or DVD-RW burner, and appropriate discs. As with a CD, the data written on a normal DVD will eventually begin to fade.<br>· <b>Remote server</b> - A well-maintained network backup server may have almost unlimited capacity, but the speed and stability of your own Internet connection will determine whether or not this is a realistic option. Keep in mind that running a backup server in your own office, while faster than copying information over the Internet, violates the requirement that you keep a copy of your important data in two different physical locations. There are free storage services on the Internet, as well, but you should very carefully consider the risks of putting your information online and you should always encrypt your backups before uploading them to servers run by organisations or individuals whom you do not know and trust.</p><img src=\"deleting2\"><h1>Backup Software</h1><p> Cobian Backup is a user-friendly tool that can be set to run automatically, at regularly scheduled times, and to include only files that have changed since your last backup. It can also compress backups to make them smaller. You can learn how to install and run it in our Cobian Backup Guide. </p><p>When using these backup tools, there are a few things you can do to help your backup system work smoothly:<br>· Organise the files on your computer. Try to move all of the folders that contain electronic documents you intend to back up into a single location, such as inside the My Documents folder.<br>· If you use software that stores its data in an application database, you should first determine the location of that database. If it is not in a convenient location, see if the program will allow you to choose a new location for its database. If it does, you can put it in the same folder as your electronic documents.<br>· Create a regular schedule to perform your backup.<br>· Try to establish procedures for all of the staff in your office who do not already have a reliable, secure backup policy. Help your colleagues understand the importance of this issue.<br>· Make sure to test the process of recovering data from your backup. Remember that, in the end, it is the restore procedure, not the backup procedure, which you really care about!</p><p>Once you have backed up your information or created a back-up process, you need to figure out a safe place to store it. Remember, this needs to be a different location to the one where the original information is! (i.e. if backing up your office files, the usb stick you use should not be kept in the office)</p><h1>Recovering from accidental file deletion</h1><p>When you delete a file in on your computer, it usually disappears from view, but its contents actually remain. Even after you empty the Recycle Bin, information from the files you deleted can usually still be found on the hard drive. See the Deleting lesson to learn more about this. Occasionally, if you accidentally delete an important file or folder, this security vulnerability can work to your advantage. There are several programs that can restore access to recently-deleted files, including a tool called Recuva - File Recovery, which you can learn how to use in our tool guide.</p><p>It is important that you do as little as possible with your computer between deleting a file and attempting to restore it. The longer you use your computer before attempting to restore the file, the less likely it is that you will succeed. This also means that you should use the portable version of Recuva instead of installing it after deleting an important file. (Or better – install it before anything happens!)</p><p>While it might sound like a lot of work to implement the policies and learn the tools described in this chapter, maintaining your backup strategy, once you have a system in place, is much easier than setting it up for the first time. And, given that backup may be the single most important aspect of data security, you can rest assured that going through this process is well worth the effort.</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Protecting Files Lesson<br>· Deleting Lesson<br>· TrueCrypt Guide<br>· Thunderbird Guide<br>· Cobian Backup Guide<br>· Recuva – File Recovery Guide</p>"));
        segmentList.add(new Segment(10, 1, "<h1>The Problem with Mobile Phones</h1><p>Mobile phones are basically insecure:</p><p>1. Information sent from a mobile phone is vulnerable<br>2. Information stored on a mobile phone is vulnerable<br>3. Mobile phones give out information about their location<br>4. Mobile phones can be used to eavesdrop</p><img src=\"mobile1\"><p>Not only can the company that runs your mobile phone network intercept your calls and text messages (if unencrypted), and monitor your location – many companies also choose, or are required, to share this information with governments if asked.</p><p>Here, we'll describe some of vulnerabilities you need to be aware of when using mobile phones of any type, and recommend ways you can stay a bit safer.</p><h2>1. Information sent from a mobile phone is vulnerable</h2> <p>Each mobile phone provider has full access to all text and voice messages sent via its network. Other people who are close to the mobile phone can also tap calls and text messages using inexpensive equipment. The safest practice is to assume that traditional calls and SMS text messages have not been secured against eavesdropping or recording.</p><img src=\"mobile2\"><p>See the Making a Call and Sending a Message Lessons to learn how to text and talk more securely. The situation can be different when you are using secure communications apps to communicate (whether by voice or text), because these apps can apply end-to-end encryption to protect your communications.</p><p>If you absolutely have to communicate sensitive information using regular phone or SMS, try to use an inconspicuous code for sensitive words that you and your contact have agreed on before hand.</p><h2>2. Information stored on a mobile phone is vulnerable</h2><p>Mobile phones can store all sorts of data: call history, text messages sent and received, address books, photos, video clips, text files. These may reveal your network of contacts, and personal information about you and your colleagues.</p><p>Some phones have encryption options available which should be applied. If you have an Android phone this can be done in Settings -> Personal -> Security -> Encryption.</p><p>Do not store confidential files and photos on your mobile phone. Move them, as soon as you can, to a safe location, as outlined in the Backing Up lesson. Frequently erase your phone call records, messages, address book entries, photos, etc. Learn more about safe deleting in the Deleting lesson.</p><img src=\"mobile3\"><p>Protect your SIM card and additional memory card (if your phone has one), as they may contain sensitive information. For example, make sure that you don’t leave them at the repair shop when your phone is being serviced. Use only trusted phone dealers and repair shops if possible. When selling, handing on or disposing of your phone make sure all information is deleted. Never hand on or sell SIM cards or memory cards – you should physically destroy them.</p><p>When capturing pictures or video it is important to be careful of privacy and safety of those pictured. For example, if you take photos or record video of a sensitive event, it might be dangerous to you or to those who appear in the recordings if your phone fell into the wrong hands. Guardian Project has created an open-source app called ObscuraCam to detect/select faces on photos and blur them. Obscuracam also deletes the original photos and if you have set up a server to upload the captured media, it provides an easy way to upload it.</p><h2>3. Phones give out information about their location</h2><p>The greatest privacy threat from mobile phones is the way that they announce your location all day and all night through the signals they broadcast. Every mobile phone automatically and regularly informs the phone service provider where it is at that moment. Only if a phone is switched off or without signal will it be prevented to send out such signals.</p><img src=\"mobile4\"><p>If you have a smartphone your location can also be tracked from apps, WI-FI or Bluetooth. Many apps use your GPS location to help them provide services, or just to collect data for their own use. You should only turn on your location when you need it and make sure that you only give location permissions to apps that you trust and that have a good reason to know where you are.</p><p>In each case, location tracking is not only about finding where someone is right now. It can also be about answering questions about people's historical activities and also about their beliefs, participation in events, and personal relationships. For example, location tracking could be used to try to find out whether certain people are in a romantic relationship, to find out who attended a particular meeting or who was at a particular protest, or to try and identify a journalist's confidential source.</p><h2>4. Phones can be used to eavesdrop on the owner</h2><p>If a phone is infected with the right malware it is possible for its microphone or camera to be turned on remotely allowing somebody to hear or see whatever is happening in the same room as the phone. This may happen even when the phone appears to be switched off.</p><img src=\"mobile5\"><p>As a result, people having a sensitive meeting or conversation are sometimes told to turn off their phones off and take out the battery. While this will make sure your phone can’t be used to listen in on you, it does have its own disadvantage: if many people at one location all switch off their phones at the same time, it's a sign to the mobile carriers that they all thought something was worth them turning their phones off, such as a sensitive meeting.</p><p>An alternative that might give less information away is to leave phones in another room where the phones' microphones wouldn't be able to overhear the conversations. If you know this wouldn’t be possible, try to take the battery out of your phone before you travel to the meeting.</p><p>Don’t forget that using a phone in public, or in places that you don't trust, makes you vulnerable to traditional eavesdropping techniques, or to having your phone stolen.</p><h1>General Precautions</h1><p>As is the case with other devices, the first line of defence for the safety of the information on your mobile phone is to physically protect the phone and its SIM card from being taken or tampered with.</p><p>· Keep your phone with you at all times and avoid leaving it out in public.<br>· Always use your phone's security lock codes or Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and keep them secret. Always change these from the default factory settings.<br>· Draw or make a mark on the SIM card, additional memory card, battery and phone with something unique and not immediately noticeable to a stranger. Place printed tamper-proof security tape over the joints of the phone if it is easily opened.  (Tamper-proof security tape can be bought cheaply and easily over the internet) This will help you easily to identify whether any of these items have been tampered with or replaced.<br>· If your phone is locked, ask someone you trust about unlocking it. A locked phone poses higher risk as it means all your data is controlled by one operator.<br>· The 15-digit serial or IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number helps to identify your phone and can be accessed by keying *#06# into most phones, by looking behind the battery of your phone or by checking in the phone's settings. Make a note of this number and keep it separate from your phone, as this number could help to trace and prove ownership quickly if it is stolen.<br>· Consider the advantages and disadvantages of registering your phone with the service provider. If you report your phone stolen, the service provider should then be able to stop further use of your phone. However, registering it means your phone usage is tied to your identity.</p><p>There are also a number of steps you can take that will help avoid your phone being easily infected with malware. This does not prevent your phone being infected, it just makes it more difficult to infect.</p><img src=\"mobile6\"><p>· Keep your software updated to keep your phone secure. There are two types of updates that need to be checked:<br> * The phone operating system: For Androids go to: settings -> About phone -> updates -> check for updates<br> * Apps you have installed: In Androids, open the Play store app, from the side menu select My Apps.<br>· Do not accept or install any unknown programmes on your phone, such as ring tones, wallpaper, apps or any others that come from an unexpected source. They may contain malware.<br>· Connect your phone to a computer only if you are sure it is malware free. Learn about how to check in the Malware lesson.  <br>· If you don't know or use any of the features and applications on your phone, disable or uninstall them if you can.<br>· Try to avoid connecting to WiFi access points that don't provide passwords.<br>· Make sure communication channels like Infrared (IrDA), Bluetooth and Wireless Internet (WiFi) on your phone are switched off and disabled if you are not using them. Use them only in trusted situations and locations. Consider not using Bluetooth, as it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on this form of communication. Instead, transfer data using a cable.<br><br>· When setting up your phone, there are a number of settings you can select and apps you can download that will help make your phone more secure. Instructions for set up can be found in the tools section: Basic Security Setup for Android.</p><h1>Burner phones</h1><p>Phones that are used temporarily and then discarded are often referred to as burner phones. People who are trying to avoid surveillance sometimes try to change phones and numbers frequently to make it more difficult to recognise their communications. They will need to use prepaid phones (not associated with a personal credit card or bank account) and ensure that the phones and SIM cards were not registered with their identity; in some countries these steps are straightforward, while in others there may be legal or practical obstacles to obtaining anonymous mobile phone service.</p><img src=\"mobile7\"><p>There are a number of limitations to burners hiding your identity.</p><p>· First, just swapping SIM cards offers minimal protection, because the network operator knows the history of which SIM cards have been used in which devices, and can track either individually or both together.<br>· Second, governments have been developing mobile location analysis techniques where location tracking can be used to generate leads or hypotheses about whether multiple devices actually belong to the same person. There are many ways this can be done. For example, an analyst could check whether two devices tended to move together, or whether, even if they were in use at different times, they tended to be carried in the same physical locations.<br>= A third problem for the successful anonymous use of telephone services is that people's calling patterns tend to be extremely distinctive. For example, you might habitually call your family members and your work colleagues. Even though each of these people receives calls from a wide range of people, you're likely the only person in the world who commonly calls both of them from the same number. So even if you suddenly changed your number, if you then resumed the same patterns in the calls you made or received, it would be straightforward to determine which new number was yours. Remember that this inference isn't made based only on the fact that you called one particular number, but rather on the uniqueness of the combination of all the numbers that you called.</p><p>Together, these facts mean that effective use of burner phones to hide from government surveillance requires, at a minimum:<br>· Not reusing either SIM cards or devices;<br>· Not carrying different devices together;<br>· Not creating a physical association between the places where different devices are used;<br>· And not calling or being called by the same people when using different devices.<br>· (This isn’t necessarily a complete list; for example, we haven’t considered the risk of physical surveillance of the place where the phone was sold, or the places where it's used, or the possibility of software to recognize a particular person's voice as an automated method for determining who is speaking through a particular phone.)</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Making a Call Lesson<br>· Sending a Message Lesson<br>· Backing Up Lesson<br>· Safe Deleting Lesson<br>· Malware Lesson<br>· ObscuraCamTool<br>· Basic Security Setup for Android</p>"));

They run in cooperation with the device's operating system and are responsible for basic operations of the hardware of your smartphone, such as the speaker, microphone, cameras, touchscreen, memory, keys, antennas, etc. Most functionalities are 'locked in' so the user is not capable of controlling or altering these functions. There are however, some applications and functionalities that can enhance the security of data and communications on a smartphone. Also there are some other existing functionalities that can be removed to avoid security risks.</p><p>For this, and other reasons, some smartphone users choose to alter the programs running the smartphone. The process of overcoming these manufacturer imposed limits on a smartphone is called rooting (in case of Android devices), or jailbreaking (in case of iOS devices, like iPhone or iPad). Successful rooting or jailbreaking will enable you to install additional applications, make modifications, and give you total control over data storage and memory of the smartphone in order to make it more secure.</p><p><i>WARNING:</i> Rooting or jailbreaking may not be a reversible process, and it requires experience with software installation and configuration. Consider the following:<br>· There is a risk of making your smartphone permanently inoperable, or 'bricking' it (i.e. turning it into a 'brick').<br>· The manufacturer or mobile carrier warranty may be voided.<br>· In some places, this process maybe illegal.</p><img src=\"mobileexp1\"><p>But if you are careful, a rooted device is a straightforward way to gain more control over your smartphone to make it much more secure.</p><p>Rooting or jailbreaking is a complex process and different for every device. Search the internet for instructions on the best way to root your own device.</p><h1>Alternative Firmware</h1><p>Rooting your phone will allow you to install alternative firmware.<br>An example of an alternative firmware for some Android phones is Cyanogenmod which allows you to uninstall applications from the system level of your phone. By doing so, you can reduce the number of ways in which your device can be monitored, such as data that is sent to your service provider without your knowledge. This sort of alternative firmware includes features such as the automatic concealment of your location when online by using a Virtual Private Network as default, and automatic incognito browsing meaning history of your communication is not recorded on your smartphone.</p><h1>Encryption of volumes</h1><p>Rooting your phone will also allow you to encrypt its entire data storage or create a volume on the smartphone to protect certain information.<br>Luks Manager allows easy, on-the-fly strong encryption of volumes with a user-friendly interface. We highly recommend that you install this tool before you start storing important data on your Android device and use the Encrypted Volumes that the Luks Manager provides to store all your data.</p><h1>Data encryption tools</h1><p>The Android Privacy Guard (APG) allows OpenGPG encryption for files and emails.

        segmentList.add(new Segment(11, 1, "<h1>Regular phone calls</h1><p>When you make a call from a landline or a mobile phone, your call is not end-to-end encrypted. If you're using a mobile phone, your call may be weakly encrypted between your handset and the cell phone towers. However as your conversation travels through the phone network, it's vulnerable to interception by your phone company and, by extension, any governments or organizations that have power over your phone company. There are also inexpensive techniques which other people can use to listen to your calls if they are close to your phone. </p><img src=\"call1\"><p><i>Regular phone calls to or from your mobile phone are not secure.</i></p><img src=\"msg1\"><h1>VoIP Calls</h1><p>The easiest way to ensure you have good encryption on voice conversations is to use VoIP instead of regular calls. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) refers to calls made using the internet. Using VoIP is generally free (or significantly cheaper than mobile phone calls) and leaves few data traces. Good call encryption software is currently only supported on a few models of smart phones.</p><p>In order to have end-to-end encrypted VoIP conversations, both parties must be using the same (or compatible) software. Conversations between providers such as Skype and mobile phones are not encrypted either, since at some point, the signal will move to the mobile network, where encryption is NOT in place.</p><h1>Making secure calls on your phone</h1><h2>Ostel</h2><p>OStel is a tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls that works on every smartphone (Blackberry, iPhone, Nokia, Android) and every desktop (Mac, PC, Linux, etc). It is one of the most secure means to communicate via voice and comes with many easy set-up wizards for different VoIP services. (The accompanying app for Android phones is CSipSimple.) Both you and the person you want to talk to will need an ostel account. It securely encrypts all your speech and makes it very difficult to trace your data and find out who you are talking to. If you download CSipSimple from ostel.co it also comes preconfigured for use with ostel, which makes it very easy to install and use.</p><h2>Redphone</h2><p>RedPhone is a free and open-source tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls that works only on Android phones. It is easy to install and very easy to use, since it integrates itself into your normal dialing and contacts system. People you want to talk to also need to install and use RedPhone. For ease of use RedPhone uses your mobile number as your identificator (like a user name on other VoIP services). However it also becomes easier to analyze the traffic it produces and trace it back to you, through your mobile number. RedPhone uses a central server, which is a point of centralization and thus puts RedPhone in a powerful position (of having control over some of this data).</p><h1>Making secure calls on your computer</h1><h2>Jitsi</h2><p>When using voice communication to exchange sensitive information it is important to choose a tool that encrypts the call all the way from your computer to the recipient's computer. We would recommend that you use the free and open-source tool, Jitsi as your choice for VoIP. You can learn how to set it up simply in Jitsi, in the tool kit. </p><h2>Skype</h2><p>Beware! Most popular VoIP providers, such as Skype and Google Hangouts, offer transport encryption so that eavesdroppers cannot listen in, but the providers themselves are still potentially able to listen in. Depending on your threat model, this may or may not be a problem, but we would recommend that you avoid Skype if you discuss sensitive information. It is important to keep in mind that Skype is owned by Microsoft, which has a commercial interest in knowing when you use Skype and from where. Skype also may allow law enforcement agencies access to all your communications history.</p><p>While we can't recommend Skype as a secure communication tool, it is very important to take some precautions if you still decide to use Skype as a tool for sensitive communication:<br>· Download and install Skype only from its official website www.skype.com to avoid a Skype program infected with spyware.<br>· Change your Skype password regularly.<br>· Set the privacy settings on Skype so that it does not keep a history of chats.<br>· Disable the Skype setting which automatically accepts incoming files, as this has occasionally been used to introduce malware/spyware onto computers.<br>· Always independently verify the identity of the person with whom you are communicating. It is easier to do this when voice chatting, especially if you know the person you want to talk to.<br>· Decide if your Skype username should identify your or have any relationship to your real name, or the name of you organisation.<br>· Be careful of what you say - develop a code system to discuss sensitive topics without using specific terminology.</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Mobile Phones Lesson<br>· OStel – Tools<br>· Redphone – Tools<br>· Jitsi – Tools</p>"));

This means that its messages now have a very strong level of verifiable security, and WhatsApp can no longer easily view or be forced to handover messages to authorities.</p><p>However it is very important to note:<br>· This only currently applies to users using WhatsApp on Android phones (users on Apple iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry and Nokia will be only get the same protection at some point in the future.)<br>· Only for messages from one individual to another individual (ie: not for group chats)<br>· Does not encrypt any pictures sent once they arrive on the phone<br>· While WhatsApp or others cannot view the content of your messages, they can still know that you are communication with someone (e.g metadata). In some cases, this may still have negative security consequences.</p><h1>Secure messaging on your computer</h1><h2>Pidgin</h2><p>Instead of using Skype, Google Talk or MSN Messenger to send messages on your computer we recommend you use the secure, free, open-source tool, Pidgin, instead.<br>Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log in to accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on MSN, talking to a friend on Google Talk, and sitting in a Yahoo chat room all at the same time. Pidgin runs on Windows, Linux, and other UNIX operating systems. </p><p>Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers, away messages, emoticons, and typing notifications.</p><h2>Adium</h2><p>A good alternative to Pidgin that works with OS X on Macs is Adium.</p>"));
        segmentList.add(new Segment(13, 1, "<p>There are a few important steps that you can take in order to increase the security of your email communication. The first is to make sure that only the person to whom you send a given message is able to read it.</p><h1>Keeping your webmail private – HTTPS</h1><p>HTTPS, (also referred to as SSL or TLS), encrypts your communications so that it cannot be read by other people on your network. This can include the other people using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or at a café, the other people at your office or school, the administrators at your ISP, malicious hackers, governments, or law enforcement officials. Communications sent over your web browser, including the web pages that you visit and the content of your emails, using HTTP rather than HTTPS are very easy for an attacker to intercept and read.</p><p>Most email providers give you a way of accessing your email using a web browser, such as Firefox or Chrome. Of these providers, most of them provide support for HTTPS. You should always make sure that your connection is secure before logging in, reading your email, or sending a message. You can tell that your email provider supports HTTPS if you log in to your webmail and the URL at the top of your browser begins with the letters HTTPS instead of HTTP (for example: https://mail.google.com).</p><p>If your email provider supports HTTPS, but does not do so by default, try replacing HTTP with HTTPS in the URL and refresh the page. If you’d like to make sure that you are always using HTTPS on sites where it is available, download the HTTPS Everywhere browser add-on for Firefox or Chrome.</p><p>Webmail providers that use HTTPS by default include Gmail, RiseUp and Yahoo.</p><p>Some webmail providers give you the option of choosing to use HTTPS by default by selecting it in your settings, such as Hotmail. </p><p>HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing that we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your seat belt when you drive.</p><img src=\"email1\"><h1>Switching to a more secure email account</h1><p>While using HTTPS protects your communications from other people on your network, there are some things that it does not do. When you send email using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted copy of your communication. Governments and law enforcement may be able to access this data with a warrant.</p><p>Yahoo and Hotmail, for instance, provide a secure connection only while you log in, to protect your password, but your messages themselves are sent and received insecurely. They also insert the IP address of the computer you are using into all of the messages you send. We do not recommend that you use them for secure communications. </p><h2>Gmail</h2><p>Gmail accounts, on the other hand, use a secure connection during log-in and all the way until you log out and, unlike Yahoo or Hotmail, Gmail avoids revealing your IP address to email recipients. One way to make Gmail (or Yahoo) even more secure is to turn on 2-step-verification. This is one of the safest and simplest computer-security measures. To break into an account with 2-Step Verification, intruders would not only have to know your username and password, they'd also have to get a hold of your phone, or codes you hold with you. Setting it up is simple: see here.</p><p>However, it is not recommend that you rely on Google for the total confidentiality of your sensitive email communication. Google scans and records the content of its users' messages for a wide variety of purposes and has, in the past, conceded to the demands of governments that restrict digital freedom. </p><h2>RiseUp</h2><p>If possible, you should create a new RiseUp email account by visiting https://mail.riseup.net. RiseUp offers free email to activists around the world and takes great care to protect the information stored on their servers. Unlike Google, they have very strict policies regarding their users' privacy and no commercial interests that might some day conflict with those policies. In order to create a new RiseUp account, however, you may need two 'invite codes.' These codes can be given out by anyone who already has a RiseUp account. Otherwise, you will need to tell RiseUp about yourself and they may give you access.</p><h1>Recipient security</h1><p>Regardless of what secure email tools you decide to use, keep in mind that every message has a sender and one or more recipients. You yourself are only part of the picture.<br>· Even if you access your email account securely, consider what precautions your contacts may or may not take when sending, reading and replying to messages.<br>· Try to learn where your contacts' email providers are located, as well. Naturally, some countries are more aggressive than others when it comes to email surveillance. To ensure private communication, you and your contacts should all use secure email services hosted in relatively safe countries.<br>· And, if you want to be certain that messages are not intercepted between your email server and a contact's email server, you might all choose to use accounts from the same provider. RiseUp is one good choice.</p><h1>Tips on improving your email security</h1><p>· Always be careful when opening email attachments that you are not expecting, that come from someone you do not know or that contain suspicious subject lines. When opening emails like this, you should ensure that your anti-virus software is up-to-date and pay close attention to any warnings displayed by your browser or email program. See more about this in the Malware lesson.<br>· Using anonymity software like Tor, which is described in the Internet lesson, can help you hide your chosen email service from anyone who might be monitoring your Internet connection. <br>· When creating an account that you intend to use while remaining anonymous from your own email recipients, or from public forums to which you might post messages by email, you must be careful to avoid using Hotmail, Yahoo, or any other webmail provider that includes your IP address in the messages you send.<br>· You may consider using several different, anonymous email accounts for communicating with different groups of people to protect of your contact network. You may also use different email accounts for signing up to Internet services which require email accounts.<br>· After all above precautions it is still very important to beware of what you write in the messages and what impact would it have if it fell into the wrong hands. One way of increasing the security of information exchange is to develop a code system for sensitive information exchange, so you would not use real names of the people, real addresses of places, etc.<br>· Remember that secure email will not do you any good if everything you type is recorded by spyware and periodically sent over the Internet to a third party. The Malware lesson and offers some advice on how to prevent this sort of thing, and the Passwords lesson will help you protect your accounts.</p><h1>Email on Smartphones</h1><p>In the first instance, consider if you really need to use your smartphone to access your email. Securing a computer and its content is generally simpler than doing so for a mobile device such as a smartphone. A smartphone is more susceptible to theft, monitoring and intrusion.</p><p>· If it is absolutely vital that you access your email on your smartphone, there are actions you can take to minimize the risks.<br>· Do not rely on smartphone as your primary means for accessing your email. Downloading (and removing) emails from an email server and storing them only on your smartphone is not advised. You can set up your email application to use only copies of emails.<br>· If you use email encryption with some of your contacts, consider installing it on your smartphone, too. The additional benefit is that encrypted emails will remain secret if the phone falls into wrong hands. See the Advanced section of this lesson for details on how to do so.</p><h1>If your email has been hacked</h1><h2>Signs</h2><p>If you suspect your email account has been hacked or compromised, you can take steps to reduce the damage done. While it is difficult to be certain, there may be clues such as:<br>· You notice any changes to your email account content or settings that you didn't make;<br>· Your email contacts notify you that they have received an email that you didn't send;<br>· You cannot login to your email account, though you are sure your password and other settings are correct;<br>· You are regularly not receiving some email messages from your colleagues that they insist that they sent to you;<br>· Some private information that was sent or received exclusively by email was made known to a third party, though neither you nor your correspondent shared it with anyone else;<br>· If on your account activity log (if your email provider offers one) you see that your account was accessed at time that you do not remember or from a place (or IP address) that you did not go to.</p><img src=\"email2\"><h2>What to do</h2><p>In such situations you may want to take some cautionary action:<br>· <b>Stop using this email account for sensitive information exchange</b>, at least until you understand the situation better.<br>· <b>Change your password</b> for this and all other accounts with a similar password as soon as possible. <br>· <b>Change your security question answers</b> (if you use them) for all accounts, so they are impossible to guess, or find the answer through researching information about you. <br>· <b>If you are not able to log in</b> to your account to change the passwords, consider getting in contact with your email provider to try to reclaim your account. <br>· <b>Mitigate information loss and impact</b> to your community. Determine what kinds of sensitive information and contacts you had in your account and decide whom you should alert. Determine what services (web, financial, etc.) you need to revisit or cancel. It is important that you <b>check the folders of your account</b> to research on what could have been sent from your account and to act accordingly. <br>· <b>Review your account settings</b> to see possible changes that has been made. Check accounts signature option for links and malware, forwarding options that would allow to copy emails that you receive to third account, away message, display name, etc.<br>· <b>Research how your account was compromised.</b> Was it because of having a weak password, or due to malware infection, etc. The more you will establish about this, the better you will be able to respond to the situation and better you will be able to protect your contacts.<br>· <b>Review security of all of your devices</b> that access emails from this account, and devices on which you stored the password to this email account. Scan your computer: learn how in the Malware lesson. Consider switching to more secure programs like Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice and other Free and Open Source Programs. After making the above improvements to the security of your devices, change your account passwords again to new, stronger ones.<br>· <b>Consider reporting hacking</b> of your account to your email provider.<br>· <b>Consider using a more secure account</b>, e.g. one that notifies you of and prevent access from unusual places or devices. Consider using account that is hosted outside of your country. Consider using email encryption, such as PGP, outlines in the Advanced section of this lesson. <br>· <b>Consider avoiding storing read emails.</b></p><p>It is important that you act quickly and precisely in the situation like this. Having a prepared and rehearsed plan may help you.</p>"));
        segmentList.add(new Segment(13, 2, "<h1>Using PGP</h1><p>If your threat model includes a government or law enforcement, or you have some other reason for wanting to make sure that your email provider is not able to turn over the contents of your email communications to a third party, you may want to consider using end-to-end encryption for your email communications. End-to-End Encryption is uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. </p><img src=\"email3\"><p>PGP is the standard for end-to-end encryption of your email. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It's actually very good privacy. If used correctly, it can protect the contents of your messages, text, and even files from being understood even by well-funded government surveillance programs. </p><p>PGP is built upon the concept of Public Key Encryption. This is a cryptographic system that uses two keys -- a public key known to everyone and a private key known only to the recipient of the message. When John wants to send a secure message to Jane, he uses Jane's public key to encrypt the message. Jane then uses her private key to decrypt it.</p><p>· So public key encryption lets you encrypt and send messages safely to anyone whose public key you know.<br>· If others know your public key, they can send you messages, which only you can decode.<br>· And if people know your public key, you can sign messages so that those people will know they could only have come from you.<br>· And if you know someone else's public key, you can decode a message signed by them, and know that it only came from them.</p><p>You should keep your private key stored somewhere safe, and protected with a long password. (If someone else gets a copy of your private key, they can pretend to be you, and sign messages claiming that they were written by you.) You can give your public key to anyone you want to communicate with you, or who wants to learn whether a message truly came from you.</p><p>Unfortunately, PGP has a reputation for being difficult to understand, or use. The good news is that there are many programs available now which can hide the ancient design of PGP and make it somewhat easier to use, especially when it comes to encrypting and authenticating email—the main use of PGP.</p><p>For detailed instructions on how to install and use PGP encryption for your email, see:<br>· How to: Use PGP for Mac OS X<br>· How to: Use PGP for Windows<br>· How to: Use PGP for Linux</p><p>Storing your private encryption key on your mobile device may seem risky. But the benefit of being able to send and store emails securely encrypted on the mobile device might outweigh the risks. Learn how to install and use encryption for email on your smartphone in the K9 and APG Guide. </p><h1>What PGP Can’t Do: Metadata</h1><p>PGP is all about making sure the contents of a message are secret, genuine, and untampered with. But that's not the only privacy concern you might have. PGP does not protect your metadata—which is everything else, including the subject line of your email, or who you are communicating with and when. Metadata can provide extremely revealing information about you even when the content of your communication remains secret.</p><p>If you're exchanging PGP messages with a known dissident in your country, you may be in danger for simply communicating with them, even without those messages being decoded. Indeed, in some countries you can face imprisonment simply for refusing to decode encrypted messages.</p><p>Protecting your metadata will require you to use other tools, such as Tor, at the same time as end-to-end encryption. You can learn how to do this in the Internet lesson. </p><p>The tool guides for PGP will explain in detail about how to create your public PGP key and how you might want to share it. In general, it’s good to keep in mind that if you are working in a dangerous environment and if would use a pseudonym generally, use that pseudonym (and alternative email) when labelling your key.</p><p>Disguising that you are communicating with a particular person is more difficult. One way to do this is for both of you to use anonymous email accounts, and access them using Tor. If you do this, PGP will still be useful, both for keeping your email messages private from others, and proving to each other that the messages have not been tampered with.</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Internet lesson<br>· PGP for Mac O SX tool<br>· PGP for Windows tool<br>· PGP for Linux tool<br>· K9 & APG tool</p>"));
        segmentList.add(new Segment(14, 1, "<h1>How To Circumvent Online Censorship</h1><p>Many governments, companies, schools, and public access points use software to prevent Internet users from accessing certain websites and Internet services. This is called Internet filtering or blocking and is a form of censorship. Content filtering comes in different forms. Sometimes entire websites are blocked and sometimes content is blocked based on keywords contained in it. One country might block Facebook entirely, or only block particular Facebook group pages—or it might block any page or web search with certain words in it.</p><p>Regardless of how content is filtered or blocked, you can almost always get the information you need by using a circumvention tool. Circumvention tools usually work by diverting your web or other traffic through another computer, so that it bypasses the machines conducting the censorship. </p><p>There are different ways of circumventing Internet censorship, some of which provide additional layers of security that you may need. The tool that is most appropriate for you depends on your threat model. If you’re not sure what your threat model is, you should work it out using the Managing Information lesson. Users with a high threat model who need to ensure total anonymity online should use tools outlined in the Advanced section of this lesson. </p><h2>HTTPS</h2><p>HTTPS is the secure version of the HTTP protocol used to access websites. Sometimes a censor will block the insecure version of a site only, allowing you to access that site simply by entering the version of the domain that starts with HTTPS. This is particularly useful if the filtering you're experiencing is based on keywords or only blocks individual web pages. HTTPS stops censors from reading your web traffic, so they cannot tell what keywords are being sent, or which individual web page you are visiting (censors can still see the domain names of all websites you visit).</p><p>If you suspect this type of simple blocking, try entering https:// before the domain in place of http://.</p><p>Try EFF’s HTTPS Everywhere plug-in to automatically turn on HTTPS for those sites that support it.</p><h2>Website variations</h2><p>Another way that you may be able to circumvent basic censorship techniques is by trying an alternate domain name or URL. For example, instead of visiting http://twitter.com, you might visit http://m.twitter.com, the mobile version of the site. Censors that block websites or web pages usually work from a blacklist of banned websites, so anything that is not on that blacklist will get through. They might not know of all the variations of a particular website's domain name—especially if the site knows it is blocked and registers more than one name.</p><h2>Web-based proxies</h2><p>A web-based proxy (such as https://proxy.org/) is one of the simplest ways of circumventing censorship. It is a website that lets its users access other, blocked or censored websites. In order to use a web-based proxy, all you need to do is enter the filtered address that you wish to use into the box in the proxy webpage; the proxy will then display the requested content inside its own webpage.</p><p>Web-based proxies are a good way to quickly access blocked websites, but they have certain disadvantages, as well.<br>· They often don’t provide any security and will be a poor choice if your threat model includes someone monitoring your internet connection.<br>· They do not always display pages correctly, and many web-based proxies will fail to load complex websites, including those that feature streaming audio and video content.<br>· And, of course, web-based proxies only work for webpages. You cannot, for example, use an instant messaging program or an email client to access blocked services through a web-based proxy.<br>· Finally, web-based proxies themselves pose a privacy risk for many users, depending on their threat model, since the proxy will have a complete record of everything you do online.</p><p>There are numerous proxy tools that use encryption, providing an additional layer of security, as well as the ability to bypass filtering. Although the connection is encrypted, the tool provider may have your personal data, meaning that these tools do not provide anonymity. They are, however, more secure than a plain web-based proxy. The simplest form of an encrypted web proxy is one that starts with “https”—this will use the encryption usually provided by secure websites. </p><h2>Virtual Private Networks</h2><p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts and sends all Internet data between your computer and another computer. This computer could belong to a commercial or non-profit VPN service, your company, or a trusted contact. A proxy server is mainly for web traffic only, but a VPN encrypts and protects all traffic. The main difference is that a VPN server encrypts your data, but a proxy server does not. A VPN also lets you use more than just the Internet – you can use it to access webpages, e-mail, instant messaging, VoIP and any other Internet service. </p><h2>Psiphon3</h2><p>Psiphon3 is a secure, public circumvention tool that combines VPN, SSH and HTTP Proxy technology to provide you with uncensored access to Internet content. It is available free online for Windows and Android. You can learn how to use it in the Psiphon3 tool guide.<br>Because Psiphon 3 is VPN-based, it is able to proxy all of your Internet traffic, not just websites. It should be noted that although Psiphon is does not allow individual user’s IP addresses to be associated with any individual website visited, Psiphon is intended primarily as a censorship evasion tool, rather than one that guarantees anonymity.</p><p>For information about other VPN services and to figure out which one might be right for you, click here. Do not use a VPN that you do not trust.</p><p>While a VPN protects your traffic from being intercepted locally, your VPN provider can still keep logs of what websites you access or even provide a third party with the ability to snoop directly on your web browsing. Depending on your threat model, the possibility of a government listening in on your VPN connection or obtaining the logs may be a significant risk and, for some users, could outweigh the short-term benefits of using a VPN. These users, or anyone who requires total anonymity online, should use Tor, as described in the Advanced section of this lesson.</p><h2>Circumventing censorship from your smartphone</h2><p>Using your smartphone to go online is often risker than using a computer. You can reduce your risks through the use of these tools.</p><h2>Proxies</h2><p>Using proxies on your mobile phone will allow you to access otherwise blocked websites. You can access proxies by downloading the mobile version of Firefox – Firefox mobile along with the Proxy Mobile add-on which makes proxying with Firefox easy. It is helpful in cases of censorship, but still may reveal your requests unless the connection from your client to the proxy is encrypted. This can be used on Androids as well as iPhones.</p><h2>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2><p>Using a VPN on your mobile will give you uncensored access to Internet content while encrypting what you do.  We recommend using the Psiphon3 tool, outlined above, which also works on Androids. </p><p>Users with a high threat model who need to ensure total anonymity online should use tools outlined in the Advanced section of this lesson.</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Managing Information lesson<br>· Psiphon3 tool guide<br>· Proxy Mobile tool guide</p><h3>FURTHER READING</h3><p>· http://en.flossmanuals.net/bypassing-censorship/</p>"));

This may put you at risk. You can reduce your risks through the use of anonymising tools such as Tor.</p><h2>Tor</h2><p>Tor is free and open-source software that provides anonymity as well as allowing you to circumvent censorship. When you use Tor, the information you transmit is safer because your traffic is bounced around a distributed network of servers. This can provide anonymity, since the computer with which you’re communicating will never see your IP address, but instead will see the IP address of the last Tor router through which your traffic travelled.</p><p>One of Tor's strengths is that it does not just work with a browser but can be used with various types of Internet software. Email programs, including Mozilla Thunderbird, and instant messaging programs, including Pidgin, can operate through Tor, either to access filtered services or to hide your use of those services.</p><p>Tor is the gold standard for secure censorship circumvention. It can be slow and tricky to use. However, it also provides a reliable, secure and public means of circumvention that saves you from having to worry about whether or not you trust the individuals who operate your proxies and the websites you visit. Tor is open source and can be downloaded free online for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.</p><p>To learn how to install and use Tor, see the Tor tool guide. </p><h1>Anonymity online on your mobile</h1><h2>Orbot and Orweb</h2><p>Orbot is a free proxy app that enables other apps to use the internet more securely.

        segmentList.add(new Segment(15, 1, "<h2>Protecting Yourself on Social Networks</h2><p>Social networking sites are some of the most popular websites and tools we use on the Internet. Facebook, Google+, and Twitter have hundreds of millions of users each. With social networking platforms come many benefits, such as the unprecedented opportunity to communicate, publish, coordinate, and persuade. Many people use it for their professional as well personal lives. But, this also means that we're sharing a lot about ourselves online, usually more than we realise. In some cases, this can put our operations, our contacts, or us at risk.</p><p>When using social networks it is important to consider:<br>· How can I interact while protecting myself, my identity, my privacy and my contacts?<br>· What information do I want keep private and who do I want to keep it private from?</p><p>Depending on your circumstances, you may need to protect yourself against the social media site itself, against other users of the site, or both. </p><h1>Setting Up Your Account</h1><h2>Take care registering </h2><p>· Consider whether you want to use your real name or not. Might you want to share things that could be dangerous if they were linked to you?<br>· When you register, don't provide more information than is necessary. Do you really need to include your birthday/contact number/employment details?<br>· If you are concerned with hiding your identity, use a separate email address. Be aware that your IP address may be logged at registration, so for full, guaranteed anonymity you may want to use a VPN or even Tor. <br>· Consider using separate accounts/identities, or maybe different pseudonyms, for different campaigns and activities. <br>· Choose a strong password, change it regularly and, if possible, enable two-factor authentication.<br>· Beware of password recovery/security questions whose answers can be mined from your social media details. For example: “What city were you born in?” or “What is the name of your pet?” You may want to choose password recovery answers that are false. One good way to remember the answers to password recovery questions, should you choose to use false answers for added security, is to note your chosen answers in a password safe. See the Password lesson for more information on how to choose and remember strong passwords.<br>· Only connect to people you know personally and trust.</p><h2>Check the Site's Privacy Policy</h2><p>Remember that information you post on most social media sites does not belong you – it is subject to the sites own policies and they can use it or share it with others. We know that reading privacy policies is a near-impossible task, but you may want to take a look at sections on how your data is used, when it is shared with other parties, and how the service responds to law enforcement requests.</p><p>Social networking sites often collect sensitive information beyond what you actually post—where you are, what interests and advertisements you react to, what other sites you've visited (e.g. through \"Like\" buttons). Be aware of what you like and repost if they may put you at risk. It can be helpful to block third-party cookies and use tracker-blocking browser extensions to make sure such information isn't being passively transmitted to third parties.</p><p>Some social networking sites, like Facebook and Twitter, have business relationships with data brokers in order to target advertisements more effectively. You can see guides that walk you through how to opt-out of these tracking schemes here:<br>· How to opt-out of Facebook's data broker relationships<br>· How to opt-out of Twitter's data broker relationships</p><h2>Change Your Privacy Settings</h2><p>Specifically, change the default settings. For example:<br>· Do you want to share your posts with the public, or only with a specific group of people?<br>· Should people be able to find you using your email address or phone number?<br>· Do you want your location shared automatically?<br>· See here for: How to change your Facebook privacy settings</p><p>Remember, privacy settings are subject to change. Be sure to pay attention to these changes closely to see if any information that was once private will be shared, or if any additional settings will allow you to take more control of your privacy.</p><h1>Using Social Media</h1><h2>Think about what you share</h2><p>Always ask the questions:<br>· Who can access the information I am putting online?<br>· Who controls and owns the information I put into a social networking site?<br>· What information about me are my contacts passing on to other people?<br>· Will my contacts mind if I share information about them with other people?<br>· Do I trust everyone with whom I'm connected?</p><p>Be careful about putting too much information into your status updates – even if you trust the people in your networks. It is easy for someone to copy your information or unintentionally share something.</p><p>It's easy to share a link to a website and get your friend's attention. But who else will be paying attention, and what kind of reaction will they have? </p><h2>Sharing videos/photos</h2><p>Photos and videos can reveal people's identities very easily. It's important that you have the consent of the subject/s of any photo or video that you post. If you are posting an image of someone else, be aware of how you may be compromising their privacy. Never post a video or photo of anyone without getting their consent first. As a good rule of thumb, don't post information, images, or updates about people you know if they aren't posting about themselves.</p><p>Photos and videos can also reveal a lot of information unintentionally. Many cameras will embed hidden data (metadata tags), that reveal the date, time and location of the photo, camera type, etc. Photo and video sharing sites may publish this information when you upload content to their sites.</p><p>Guardian Project has created an open-source app called ObscuraCam to detect/select faces on photos and blur them. Obscuracam also deletes the original photos and if you have set up a server to upload the captured media, it provides an easy way to upload it.</p><h2>Check what your friends share about you</h2><p>Remember that you’re not the only person who can give away potentially sensitive data about yourself. Your friends can tag you in photos, report your location, and make their connections to you public in a variety of ways. You may have the option of untagging yourself from these posts, but privacy does not work retroactively. You may want to talk to your friends about what you do and do not feel comfortable having them share about you in public.</p><h2>Think about what you join</h2><p>What information are you giving to people if you join a group or community? What does it say about you? Alternatively, what are people announcing to the world if they join a group or community that you have created? How are you putting people at risk?</p><p>Also if you join a group with a large number of members that you don't know, then this can compromise any privacy or security settings that you have applied to your account, so think about what information you are giving away before joining. Are you using your photo and real name so strangers can identify you?</p><h2>Don’t use social media sites for instant chats</h2><p>Many social networking sites have tools that allow you to have discussions with your friends in real time. These operate like Instant Messaging and are one of the most insecure ways to communicate on the internet, both because they may reveal who you are communicating with, and what you are communicating about.</p><p>Never engage in chats with people you don’t know, especially those who want to send you documents or pictures. This is a method commonly used by authorities to put malware in activists’ computers.</p><p>You should use a specific application for your chats, such as Pidgin with an Off-the-record plugin, which uses encryption. Read the Sending a Message lesson or Pidgin tool guide to find out how. </p><h2>Don’t rely on social media for storage</h2><p>Be cautious about how safe your content is on a social networking site. Never rely on a social networking site as a primary host for your content or information. It is very easy for governments to block access to a social networking site within their boundaries if they suddenly find its content objectionable. </p><h2>Access sites securely</h2><p>Access social networking sites using https:// to safeguard your username, password and other information you post. Using https:// rather than http:// adds another layer of security by encrypting the traffic from your browser to your social networking site. </p><p>Be careful when accessing your social network account in public internet spaces. Delete your password and browsing history when using a browser on a public machine.</p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Password lesson<br>· How to opt-out of Facebook's data broker relationships<br>· How to opt-out of Twitter's data broker relationships<br>· How to change your Facebook privacy settings<br>· ObscuraCam <br>· Sending a Message lesson<br>· Pidgin tool guide</p><h3>FURTHER READING</h3><p>· https://securityinabox.org/social_networking_tools</p>"));
        segmentList.add(new Segment(16, 1, "<p>Radios are an insecure method of communication and should not be used for senstive communication if at all possible. If possible, use alternative options as outlined in the Making a Call lesson. However many in the humanitarian field still need to use them sometimes. If necessary, develop a system of code words between those communicating so that your message will not be so easily understood.</p><h1>VHF radios</h1><p>Very High Frequency (VHF) radios operate in the 30 to 300 MHz range. Usually handheld, they can communicate over short ranges, approximately 10 kilometers, in most cases. They are often referred to as “line of sight,” though in many circumstances they can effectively reach beyond that. Thick trees and buildings can obstruct VHF signals. Elevating the VHF antenna may improve the radio’s transmission range. Also, installing a repeater, which automatically receives and re-transmits radio signals, can further extend the range. Repeater systems are reliable and require little maintenance. Before using a VHF radio or repeater, it may be necessary to obtain authorisation from the host government.</p><p>The advantages of VHF radios are:<br>· Fairly inexpensive; <br>· User-friendly; <br>· Sturdily built: can be dropped, withstands rain, etc.; <br>· Well-positioned repeaters can increase area coverage; and <br>· 24-hour contact if users are monitoring the VHF.</p><p>Disadvantages are:<br>· Not secure – anybody can listen in;<br>· Limited battery life (need for spare batteries/ongoing recharge); <br>· Badly placed repeaters greatly limit the utility of the network; <br>· Hand-held units are frequently lost or stolen; <br>· Repeaters are very vulnerable to intentional damage; and <br>· Highly dependent on the topography of the area (handset-to-handset, 2–5km; handset to base, mobile or repeater, 7–15km. Obstacles in between, such as high buildings or hills, will interfere with the signal; positioning on a high point can increase range).</p><p>The most commonly used brand is Motorola. </p><h1>High Frequency radios</h1><p>HF (High Frequency) radios, in the 3 to 30 MHz frequency range, allow voice communications over medium and long range (conceivably around the world). Less affected by obstacles, HF signals can “bend” around hills and buildings and do not require repeaters to function over long ranges. However, the transmission range of HF signals may be influenced by time of day, weather conditions, electrical interference, and poor system configuration. It takes skill to achieve reliable HF connectivity over long distances. HF radios are often installed in vehicles or at base stations. HF systems are generally more expensive than VHF and require more maintenance. </p><p>The advantages of HF radios are: <br>· Short- to extremely long-range communication without a relay station; <br>· Less affected by topographical variation; <br>· High degree of independence; <br>· Easy to network, with multiple stations sharing the frequency; <br>· Messages can be sent simultaneously to multiple destinations; <br>· Monitoring is simple; <br>· Well-adapted for use in vehicles; <br>· Adaptable to changing operational conditions; <br>· Relatively cheap to purchase; no call charges; <br>· Relatively easy to diversify functions of the network (voice, fax, GPS tracking, SITOR or PACTOR data transmission); <br>· Possible to integrate with other networks (phone/email); and<br>· Requires limited maintenance. </p><p>The disadvantages are: <br>· Not secure – anybody can listen in;<br>· Requires registration and licensing in most countries; <br>· Transmission strength varies during the day depending on solar activity; <br>· ‘skip zone’: no reception between maximum extent of direct wave (ground wave)  and  longer  radius  starting  with  the  closest  reflections  from  the ionosphere; <br>· Staff have to be trained in order to take full advantage of the network; and<br>· Technical expertise needed for installation, and HF can interfere with other electronic equipment if not installed correctly. </p><p>A radio set should have the following capabilities. <br>· Remote diagnostics:  one unit can interrogate another to get details on operational factors such as power output, signal strength and battery voltage. This allows for diagnosis of potential impediments by a technician who does not have to be physically present at the unit. <br>· Emergency call: distress signals are automatically sent out to a number of pre-programmed stations, prioritising the urgency of the call for the receiver. <br>· A GPS connected to a personal computer with tracking software installed can interrogate a GPS connected to a mobile unit without the occupants of the vehicle being aware that this is happening. Vehicle movements can thus be monitored. Carefully consider the risks of others monitoring such tracking software before applying it.</p><p>The most commonly used brands of HF radios are Codan and Barrett. </p><h1>Radio procedures </h1><p>The benefits of radio equipment can be maximized by following simple standard radio procedures. </p><p>· Equipment is maintained in optimum condition.  <br>· Staff and visitors are trained in the use of radios.  <br>· All authorized frequencies and selective calling lists are posted at base stations and in mobile units.  <br>· Radios are monitored 24 hours a day in moderate, high, or severe risk alert countries.  <br>· Each communication has clarity, brevity and security. To ensure effective communication, use the following procedures: <br> * Ensure no one else is transmitting at the same time. Wait for ongoing discussions to finish and the users to sign off before beginning transmission. <br> * Make message brief but precise.  <br> * Use common procedure words.  <br> * Use call signs instead of personal names. Do not identify organizations or personnel by name over the radio.  <br> * Break the message into sensible passages with clear pauses between.  <br> * Maintain clear speech with normal rhythm and moderate volume.  <br> * Hold the microphone approximately five centimeters from mouth.  <br> * Avoid excessive calling. Use radios for work-related purposes only.  <br> * Never transmit specific security-related information or travel plans or discuss transfer of cash or goods.  <br>· Use of duress code words is encouraged for all risk levels. Duress code words are generally innocuous words or phrases selected for use over the radio or telephone to indicate that the speaker is in a threatening situation but not free to communicate.</p><h1>Satellite phones</h1><p>Satellite phones, which provide high-quality, direct-dial voice, fax, and e-mail, are often used to supplement a radio network, especially in moderate- to high-risk areas. Today’s satellite terminals are rugged, portable, and may be cheaper to operate than cellular phones in some areas. Modern satellite phone networks encrypt voice traffic to prevent eavesdropping and so are usually thought of as safer than radios. However, anyone with cheap computer equipment and radio could eavesdrop on calls by breaking this encryption quite easily. </p><h3>RELATED LESSONS/TOOLS</h3><p>· Making a Call</p>"));

Messenger, Facebook chat, Windows Live Messenger, AIM, ICQ, and XMPP.</p><p>OTR  (Off-the-record) is a protocol that allows people to have confidential conversations using the messaging tools they’re already familiar with. This should not be confused with Google's “Off the record,” which merely disables chat logging, and does not have encryption or verification capabilities. For Mac users, OTR comes built-in with the Adium client.</p><p>OTR employs end-to-end encryption. This means that you can use it to have conversations over services like Google Hangouts or Facebook without those companies ever having access to the contents of the conversations. This is different from the way in which Google and AOL use the term “off the record” to mean that a conversation is not being logged; that option does not encrypt your conversation.</p><h3>Why should I use Adium + OTR?</h3><p>When you have a chat conversation using Google Hangouts or Facebook chat on the Google or Facebook websites, that chat is encrypted using HTTPS , which means the content of your chat is protected from hackers and other third parties while it’s in transit. It is not, however, protected from Google or Facebook, which have the keys to your conversations and can hand them over to authorities.</p><p>After you have installed Adium, you can sign in to it using multiple accounts at the same time. For example, you could use Google Hangouts, Facebook, and XMPP simultaneously. Adium also allows you to chat using these tools without OTR. Since OTR only works if both people are using it, this means that even if the other person does not have it installed, you can still chat with them using Adium.</p><p>Adium also allows you to do out-of-band verification to make sure that you’re talking to the person you think you’re talking to and you are not being subject to a MITM attack. For every conversation, there is an option that will show you the key fingerprints it has for you and the person with whom you are chatting. A \"key fingerprint\" is a string of characters like \"342e 2309 bd20 0912 ff10 6c63 2192 1928,” that’s used to verify a longer public key. Exchange your fingerprints through another communications channel, such as Twitter DM or email, to make sure that no one is interfering with your conversation.</p><h3>Limitations: When should I not use Adium + OTR?</h3><p>Technologists have a term to describe when a program or technology might be vulnerable to external attack: they say it has a large “attack surface.” Adium has a large attack surface. It is a complex program, which has not been written with security as a top priority. It almost certainly has bugs, some of which might be used by governments or even big companies to break into computers that are using it. Using Adium to encrypt your conversations is a great defense against the kind of untargeted dragnet surveillance that is used to spy on everyone's Internet conversations, but if you think you will be personally targeted by a well-resourced attacker (like a nation-state), you should consider stronger precautions, such as PGP -encrypted email.</p><h3>Installing Adium + OTR On Your Mac</h3><p>Step 1: Install the program</p><p>First, go to https://adium.im/ in your browser. Choose “Download Adium 1.5.9.” The file will download as a .dmg, or disk image, and will probably be saved to your “downloads” folder.</p><p>Double-click on the file; that will open up a window that looks like this:</p><img src=\"tool_adium1\"><p>Move the Adium icon into the “Applications” folder to install the program. Once the program is installed, look for it in your Applications folder and double-click to open it.</p><p>Step 2: Set up your account(s)</p><p>First, you will need to decide what chat tools or protocols you want to use with Adium. The setup process is similar, but not identical, for each type of tool. You will need to know your account name for each tool or protocol, as well as your password for each account.</p><p>To set up an account, go to the Adium menu at the top of your screen and click “Adium” and then “Preferences.” This will open a window with another menu at the top. Select “Accounts,” then click the “+” sign at the bottom of the window. You will see a menu that looks like this:</p><img src=\"tool_adium2\"><p>Select the program that you wish to sign in to. From here, you will be prompted either to enter your username and password, or to use Adium’s authorization tool to sign in to your account. Follow Adium’s instructions carefully.</p><h3>How to Initiate an OTR Chat</h3><p>Once you have signed in to one or more of your accounts, you can start using OTR.</p><p><b>Remember: In order to have a conversation using OTR, both people need to be using a chat program that supports OTR.</b></p><p>Step 1: Initiate an OTR chat</p><p>First, identify someone who is using OTR, and initiate a conversation with them in Adium by double-clicking on their name. Once you have opened the chat window, you will see a small, open lock in the upper left-hand corner of the chat window. Click on the lock and select “Initiate Encrypted OTR Chat.”</p><p>Step 2: Verify your connection</p><p>Once you have initiated the chat and the other person has accepted the invitation, you will see the lock icon close; this is how you know that your chat is now encrypted (congratulations!) – But wait, there’s still another step!</p><p>At this time, you have initiated an unverified, encrypted chat. This means that while your communications are encrypted, you have not yet determined and verified the identity of the person you are chatting with. Unless you are in the same room and can see each other’s screens, it is important that you verify each other’s identities. (For more information, read the EFF module on Key Verification.)</p><p>To verify another user’s identity using Adium, click again on the lock, and select “Verify.” You will be shown a window that displays both your key and the key of the other user. Some versions of Adium only support manual fingerprint verification. This means that, using some method, you and the person with whom you’re chatting will need to check to make sure that the keys that you are being shown by Adium match precisely.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to read them aloud to one another in person, but that’s not always possible. There are different ways to accomplish this with varying degrees of trustworthiness. For example, you can read your keys aloud to one another on the phone if you recognize each other’s voices or send them using another verified method of communication such as PGP. Some people publicise their key on their website, Twitter account, or business card.</p><p><b>The most important thing is that you verify that every single letter and digit matches perfectly.</b></p><p>Now that you have initiated an encrypted chat and verified your chat partner’s identity, there’s one more thing you need to do. Unfortunately, Adium logs your OTR-encrypted chats by default, saving them to your hard drive. This means that, despite the fact that they’re encrypted, they are being saved in plain text on your hard drive.</p><p>To disable logging, click “Adium” in the menu at the top of your screen, then “Preferences.” In the new window, select “General” and then disable “Log messages” and “Log OTR-secured chats.” Your settings should now look like this:</p><img src=\"tool_adium3\"><p>Also, when Adium displays notifications of new messages, the contents of those messages may be logged by the OS X Notification Center. This means that while Adium leaves no trace of your communications on your own computer or your correspondent's, either your or their computer's version of OS X may preserve a record. To prevent this, you may want to disable notifications.</p><p>To do this, select \"Events\" in the Preferences window, and look for any entries that say \"Display a notification.\" For each entry, expand it by clicking the gray triangle, and then click the newly-exposed line that say \"Display a notification,\" then click the minus icon (\"-\") at the lower left to remove that line.\" If you are worried about records left on your computer, you should also turn on full-disk encryption, which will help protect this data from being obtained by a third party without your password.</p><img src=\"tool_adium4\">"));

ChatSecure allows users to send instant messages and chats using a cell phone, instead of with a traditional desktop or laptop computer. It's compatible with iPhone and Android phones.</p><p>ChatSecure supports OTR  encryption  over XMPP. All messages sent via ChatSecure are completely private, so long as the person you are chatting with is also using an OTR compatible instant messaging client like ChatSecure, Adium, Pidgin, or Jitsi. The app’s capabilities allow it to deliver audio messages, photos, files, or text.</p><p>When you send messages using ChatSecure, they are not stored on the phone system's memory. ChatSecure used with the privacy plugin Orbot should be able to bypass most firewalls, network restrictions, and blacklists. The app can manage multiple accounts, so you can chat with your Facebook friends, Google contacts, or other privacy conscious users that use an instant messaging program that supports OTR encryption.</p><h3>How to install and configure ChatSecure</h3><p>1. Download and install ChatSecure</p><p>Visit the Apple App Store or Google Play store and search for ChatSecure by The Guardian Project. Select “Install” and accept the Terms of Service by clicking “Accept.” The app will download and install automatically.</p><p>2. Open the app and set your password</p><p>When you open the app you will be promoted to set a password. You will be prompted to create a passphrase  in order to locally encrypt your data. If you choose to do this, your data will be encrypted in transit, as well as encrypted locally on your phone.<br>If you choose to skip this step, your messages will still be encrypted in transit, but will not be protected on your device. For more information on selecting a strong passphrase, see the Passwords lesson.</p><p>3. Configure your accounts</p><p>You can add a variety of different accounts your ChatSecure app. To add GoogleTalk or Google Hangouts, choose “Google.” To add any XMPP or Jabber messaging service, choose “Jabber (XMPP).” To add your Facebook account, also choose “Jabber (XMPP).”<br>Once you’ve added your account, type in your username (or email address) and your password to sign in. Your contacts should load automatically.</p><p>To add a second or third account, click on the “accounts” tab in the menu. In the upper right hand corner, click on the “+” sign. You can either choose to add an existing account or create a new account.</p><h3>How to use ChatSecure</h3><p>1. Sign in to your accounts</p><p>To sign in to your account, click on the “accounts” tab in the menu and turn on the accounts you wish to use. Once you sign in, anyone can connect with you from a mobile or desktop instant messaging application.</p><p>2. Start end-to-end encryption</p><p>Once you’ve started a chat with someone, click on the unlocked lock icon on the top menu bar of the display. Choose “Start Encryption.” If the person you are chatting with has an OTR compatible instant messaging system, then you will have the option to verify your (and their) fingerprint.</p><p>ChatSecure offers three ways to verify OTR fingerprints, but if you're chatting with someone over a desktop instant messenger and not with ChatSecure, the best way to verify an OTR fingerprint is by communicating through another channel. You can resend your fingerprint over an SMS (TextSecure), say it over the phone if you recognize one another's voices, use PGP email, or verify in person. Click on “manual verification” and ChatSecure will display your and your friend's fingerprints. If you can confirm that you both have the same information, you can click “verify.”</p><p>ChatSecure supports manual verification or verification by scanning the other user’s barcode (QR). If you are in the same room as the other person, you can easily scan the barcode on their phone or read your keys aloud to one another.</p><p>3. Understand your options</p><p>· Just like a desktop instant messaging service, ChatSecure gives you the option to appear offline, busy, idle, or away. To change this setting click on your name at the top of your friends list.<br>· ChatSecure also allows you to initiate group chats and add new contacts, both of which can be done from the main menu. (Note that group chats cannot be secured like one-on-one chats due to limitations of the OTR protocol.)<br>· The app supports multimedia messaging, can take pictures, and can send photos and files securely if your friend is also using end-to-end encryption and you are able to verify her identity.<br>· ChatSecure gives you the option to create a new XMPP or Jabber messaging account that supports OTR encryption.

If you then run an <i>Differential</i> or <i>Incremental</i> backup, the file will be updated.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You will only be able to run a full or 'dummy backup' if you <i>disable this option</i> (the dummy backup option is explained below).</p><h3>2.1.2 Backup type Descriptions</h3><p><i>Full:</i> This option means that every single file in the source location will be copied to your backup directory. If you have enabled the <i>Create separated backups using timestamp</i> option, you will have several copies of the same source (identified by the time and date of the backup in the folder title). Otherwise, Cobian Backup will overwrite the previous version (if any).</p><p><i>Incremental:</i> This option means the program will verify if the files selected for backup have been changed since the last backup was performed. If there has been no change, it will be skipped over during the backup process, saving backup time. The <i>Use file attribute logic</i> option needs to be checked in order to perform this backup.</p><p><i>Differential:</i> The program will check if the source has been changed from the last <b>full</b> backup. If there is no need to copy that file, it will be skipped, saving backup time. If you have run a full backup before on the same set of files, then you can continue backing it up, using the Differential method.</p><p><i>Dummy task:</i> You can use this option to get your computer to run or shut down programs at certain times. This is a more advanced option which is not really relevant to our basic backup procedure.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “OK” to confirm your search options and parameters for your backup task.</p><h3>2.2 How to Create a Backup File</h3><p>To begin creating a backup file, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click “Files” in the left sidebar of the <i>New task</i> window to display a <i>blank</i> version of the following screen:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian6\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select the files you want to back up. (In <i>Figure 3</i> above, the <i>My Documents</i> folder is selected.)</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Add” in the <i>Source</i> pane to activate the <i>Directory</i> menu.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Select <i>Directory</i> if you want to back up an entire directory, and <i>Files</i> to back up individual files. To specify individual files or directories to be backed up, select <i>Manually</i>, and type in the file path or directory for your backup.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You can add as many files or directories as you like. If you wish to back up files currently on your FTP server, choose the FTP site option (you will need to have the appropriate server login details).</p><p>When you have selected the files and/or folders, they will appear in the <i>Source</i> area. As you can see in <i>Figure 3</i> above, the <i>My Documents</i> folder is displayed there, meaning this folder will now be included in the backup task.</p><p>The <i>Destination</i> pane specifies where the backup will be stored.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click “Add” in the <i>Destination</i> pane to activate the Directory menu.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Select <i>Directory</i> to open a browser window where you select the destination folder for your backup file.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you want to create several versions of the backup file, you may specify several folders here. If you selected the <i>Manually</i> option, you must type in the full path to the folder where you want to keep the backup. To use a remote Internet server to store your archive, select the FTP site option (you will need to have the appropriate server login details).</p><p>The screen should now resemble the example above example with file(s) and/or folder(s) in the source area and folder(s) in the destination area. However, don't click <i>OK</i> just yet! You still need to set a schedule for your backup.</p><h3>2.3 How to Schedule Your Backup Task</h3><p>For your automatic backup to work, you need to fill in the <i>Schedule</i> section. This section lets you specify when you want the backup to be performed.<br>To set the schedule options, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Select “Schedule” from the left sidebar, to activate the following pane:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian7\"><p>The <i>Schedule type</i> options are listed in the drop-down menu, and described below:</p><p><i>Once:</i> The backup will be done once only at the date and time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Daily:</i> The backup will be done every day at the time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Weekly:</i> The backup will be done on the days of the week selected. In the example above, the backup will be done on Fridays. You may select other days also. The backup will be done on all days selected at the time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Monthly:</i> The backup will be done on the days typed into the days of the month box at the time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Yearly:</i> The backup will be done on the days typed into the days of the month box, during the month specified, and at the time specified in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Timer:</i> The backup will be done repeatedly at intervals specified in the Timer text box in the <i>Date/Time</i> area.</p><p><i>Manually:</i> You will have to run the backup yourself from the main program window.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “OK” to confirm the options and settings for the backup schedule as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian8\"><p>Once you have decided on a backup schedule, you have completed the final step. The backup will now run on the folders specified according to the schedule you have chosen.</p><h3>3.0 How to Compress Your Backup File</h3><p><b>Step 1.</b> Create a backup task as documented in section 2.3, containing the backup files you want to archive.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select “Archive” from the left sidebar to activate the <i>New task</i> screen as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian9\"><p>The <b>Compression</b> pane is used to specify the method for compressing your backup.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Compression is used to reduce the amount of space for file storage. If you have a bunch of old files that you use only occasionally, but you still want to keep, it would make sense to store them in a format where they take up as little space as possible. Compression works by removing a lot of unnecessary coding out of your documents, while leaving important information intact. Compression does not damage your original data. The files are not viewable when compressed. The process must be reversed and your files 'decompressed' when you want to view the files again.</p><p>The three sub-options in the <i>Compression type</i> drop-down list are:</p><p><i>No Compression:</i> This option does not perform any compression, as you would expect.</p><p><i>Zip Compression:</i> This option is the standard compression technique for <b>Windows</b> systems, and the most convenient. Archives once created can be opened with standard Windows tools (or you can download the ZipGenius program to access them).</p><p>Selecting a compression type listed automatically enables the <i>Split options</i> section, and its corresponding drop-down list.</p><p>The <i>Split options</i> apply to storage on removable media, for example CDs, DVDs, floppy disks and USB memory sticks. The various split options will subdivide the archive into sizes that will fit onto your storage device of choice.</p><p>Example: Let's say that you are archiving a large number of files, and you want to burn them to a CD. However, your archive size turns out to be larger than 700MB (the size of a CD). The splitting function will split the archive into pieces smaller than or equal to 700MB, which you can then burn onto your CDs. If you are planning to back up onto your computer's hard disk, or the files that you want to back up are smaller than the device you plan to store them on, you can skip this section.</p><p>The following options are available to you when you click on the <i>Split options</i> drop-down list. Your choice will depend on the type of removable storage device available to you.</p><img src=\"tool_cobian10\"><p>· 3,5\" - Floppy disk. This option is big enough to perform backup of a small number of documents<br>· Zip - Zip Disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a special Zip Drive in your computer and the custom-made disks<br>· CD-R - CD disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a CD Writer in your computer and a CD writing program (see DeepBurner Free version or other disk burning tools).<br>· DVD - DVD disk (check the capacity of the one you are using). You will need a DVD Writer in your computer and a DVD writing program (see DeepBurner Free version or other disk burning tools).</p><p>If you are backing up onto several USB memory sticks you may want to set a custom size.</p><p>To do this, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1. Select</b> the <i>Custom size</i> (bytes) option, then type the size of the archive in bytes into the text field.</p><p>To give you an idea of sizes<br>· 1KB (kilobyte) = 1024 bytes - a one-page text document made in Open Office is approximately 20kb<br>· 1MB (megabyte) = 1024 KB - a photo taken on a digital camera is usually between 1 - 3 MB<br>· 1GB (gigabyte) = 1024 MB - approximately half hour of a DVD quality movie</p><p><b>Note:</b> When choosing a custom size to split your backup for a CD or DVD disk, Cobian Backup will not copy the backup to your removable device automatically. Rather, it will create your archive in those files on the computer and you will need to burn them to the CD or DVD disk yourself.</p><p><i>Password Protect:</i> This option lets you enter a password to protect the archive. Simply type, then re-type a password into the two boxes provided. When you try to decompress the archive, you will be asked for the password before the task commences.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you want to secure your archive, you should think about using another method than a password. Cobian Backup lets you encrypt your archive. This is covered below.</p><p><i>Comment:</i> This option lets you write something descriptive about the archive, but it is not a requirement.</p><h3>3.1 How to Decompress Your Backup File</h3><p>To decompress your backup, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1. Select > Tools > Decompressor.</b></p><p>The Decompressor window appears as follows:</p><img src=\"tool_cobian11\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click on the open file icon to open a browse window to enable you to select the archive you want to decompress.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Select the archive (<i>.zip</i> or <i>.7x</i> file) and then click “OK”.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Select a directory into which you will unpack (output) the archived file.</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Click on the compression icon to open another window that lets you choose the folder in which to unpack the archive.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Select a folder, and then click “OK”.</p><p>Use Windows Explorer to view the files that go to that folder.</p><h3>4.0 About Encryption</h3><p>Encryption may be a necessity for those wishing to keep their backup secure from unauthorised access. Encryption is the process of encoding, or scrambling, data in such a way that it appears unintelligible to anyone who does not have the specific key needed to decode the message. For more information on encryption, read the Protecting Files lesson.</p> <h3>4.1 How to Encrypt Your Backup File</h3><p>The <i>Strong encryption</i> pane is used to specify the encryption method to be used.</p><p><b>Step 1.</b> Click the <i>Encryption</i> type drop-down box to activate its list of different encryption methods. </p><p>To keep things simple, we recommend that you choose from either the <i>Blowfish</i> or the <i>Rijndael</i> (128 bits) methods. These will provide excellent security for your archive, and let you access the encrypted data with a chosen password.</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Select the <i>Encryption</i> type you want to use.</p><p><b>Note:</b> <i>Rijndael</i> and <i>Blowfish</i> both offer approximately the same level of security. <i>DES</i> is weaker but the encryption process is faster.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Type and re-type the password into the two boxes provided.</p><p>The strength of the password is indicated by the bar marked 'Passphrase quality'. The further the bar moves to the right, the stronger the passphrase. Refer to the <b>Passwords lesson</b> for information on creating and storing strong passwords.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Click “OK”.</p><h3>4.2 How to Decrypt Your Backup File</h3><p>Decrypting your backup file is easy and quick. To decrypt your backup file, perform the following steps:</p><p><b>Step 1. Select > Tools > Decrypter and Keys:</b></p><p><i>This will activate the Decrypter and Keys window as follows:</i></p><img src=\"tool_cobian12\"><p><b>Step 2.</b> Click “Select” to select the archive you want to decrypt.</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Click “Destination” to select the folder in which to store the decrypted archive.</p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Select the same encryption type you selected earlier, in section 4.1 How to Encrypt Your Backup File, in the <i>Methods</i> drop-down list.</p><p><b>Step 4. Select</b> the appropriate encryption method (the one you used to encrypt your backup file).</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Type your passphrase into the <i>Passphrase</i> text fields.</p><p><b>Step 6.</b> Click “Decrypt!”</p><p>The file(s) will be decrypted to the location that you specified. If the files were also compressed, you will need to decompress them as outlined in section 3.1 How to Decompress Your Backup.</p>"));

Graph Search allows users to make structured searches to filter through friends, friends of friends, and strangers. This feature relies on your profile information being made widely or publicly available, yet there are some Likes, photos, or other pieces of information that you might not want out there.</p><p>Since Facebook removed the ability to remove yourself from search results altogether, the Electronic Frontier Foundation put together a quick how-to guide to help you take control over what is featured on your Facebook profile and on Graph Search results – we have outlined it below. (Facebook also has a new video explaining how to control what shows up in Graph Search.)</p><h3>What's public on my profile?</h3><p>Click on the lock in the top menu bar, and under \"Who can see my stuff?\" click \"View As.\" This will take you to the public view of your profile. Here you can see exactly what information, photos, and posts are available to the public. If there's anything you don't want the whole Facebook universe to be able to see, you can change individual settings to hide particular items.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook1\"><h3>How do I hide my general information?</h3><p>Go to your profile page and click \"Update Info.\" You can control who is able to see what personal information you've listed—and if they're able to see it, they're able to search it.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook2\"><h3>Who can see my posts, both past and future?</h3><p>You can access your privacy settings by clicking on the lock in the top menu bar, then clicking \"See More Settings.\" From here, you can choose your audience for future posts (including photos), and you can also limit who has access to previous posts that were more widely accessible.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook3\"><h3>How do I hide my photo albums?</h3><p>Go to your profile page and click on \"Photos,\" then \"Albums.\" You can configure who has access to each album.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook4\"><p>Note that tagging others in a photo by default gives their friends the ability to see that photo. Also note that removing a photo from your Timeline does not remove it from being searched, especially if it is someone else's photo.</p><p>In order to make sure that photo is not searchable, you must detag yourself or report the photo. Facebook has another great video about how to do just this.</p><p>To detag yourself, click on a photo, and on the bottom of the picture click on \"Options.\" Next, click \"Report/Remove Tag.\" This gives you the option to remove your tag, as well as to notify the poster that you'd like the photo to be taken down.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook6\"><img src=\"tool_facebook5\"><h3>How do I hide my \"Likes\"?</h3><p>Go to your profile page and click on \"Likes.\" Click \"Edit\" on the top right. From there, you can edit who can see your liked pages in each individual category.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook7\"><h3>Do I actually \"Like\" these things?</h3><p>While you are configuring your \"Likes,\" we encourage you to take a moment to reassess the pages you have listed. A few years later, you may not like \"Free Booze Fridays\" anymore. Unliking is as simple as going to a particular page, hovering your mouse over \"Liked,\" and clicking \"Unlike.\"</p><img src=\"tool_facebook8\"><h3>How do I hide my friends and relationships?</h3><p>Besides locking down your own personal information, it turns out that your friends and relationships can appear in searches associated with you. Because they have no control over how they appear in such searches, we strongly encourage you to do the altruistic thing and lock down your friendship settings. Here's how to set your privacy settings to keep your friendships and relationships—and therefore related search results—limited in visibility to only whom you want.</p><p>First, go to your profile and click on \"Friends.\" On the top right of the page, click on the \"Edit\" button. This allows you to select who can see your friend list.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook9\"><p>Next, you should adjust the settings of your relationships and family associations. Go to your profile and click \"Update Info,\" then scroll down to \"Family\" on the bottom left. When you click \"Edit,\" you can choose the specific privacy settings for each relationship.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook10\"><h3>Keep it up!</h3><p>The most important think you can do is to check your privacy settings often—especially after new features are released. Facebook has done a better job of making new privacy settings more accessible while also notifying users of any changes. Their explanations, however, can lose sight of bigger picture concerns.</p><h1>HOW TO HOW TO OPT-OUT OF FACEBOOK'S DATA BROKER RELATIONSHIPS</h1><h2>How to opt-out of Facebook's data broker relationships</h2><p><b>Lesson to read: Social Media</b><br><b>Other reading:</b> https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/4-simple-changes-protect-your-privacy-online<br><b>Level:</b> Beginner<br><b>Time required:</b> 30 minutes</p><p>Facebook is teaming up with four of the world’s largest corporate data brokers to “enhance” the ad experience for users. Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai obtain information gathered about users through online means (such as through cookies when users surf the web) as well as through offline means (such as through loyalty cards at supermarkets and product warranty cards).  Facebook will use this information to tailor its ads. The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes what this means and how you can avoid it.</p><p>In practical terms, this means that limiting how much information you put on Facebook is not enough to limit how ads are targeted to you on Facebook. Your interests, age, shopping history (including offline), web browsing, location, and much more could be stored by these data brokers and utilized to market to you – even if you’ve been careful not to share this type of information with Facebook.</p><p>So, what can users do? If you’re concerned about this practice, you can opt out of the targeted advertisements by individually visiting each of the data broker partners currently working with Facebook. We've got directions below for opting out of each site.</p><p>We also have two general tips:</p><p><b>1.  Install an add-on to protect your privacy online.</b> Facebook is using \"blind cookie-matching\" to match up users of online marketer BlueKai with specific Facebook accounts. Blocking trackers is a good general practice for stopping this type of tracking. We recommend you use a tool such as Ghostery (now available on Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer).</p><p><b>2. Avoid giving your phone number and email address to companies when possible.</b> Facebook and these companies are primarily using hashed email addresses to match users between databases, though they may also use hashed phone numbers. If you’re filling out a survey or signing up to receive email updates from a website, consider creating and using a different email address than the one you associate with your Facebook account. Similarly, consider setting up an alternate phone number you can give to companies apart from the phone number you connect with your social media accounts.</p><h3>Opt Out Instructions:</h3><p>Note that in general, opting out of data brokers will not necessarily result in your data being removed from their lists. Instead, these companies will generally 'suppress' your information from certain uses -- including, hopefully, in the batches of data sent to Facebook. The process below takes a bit of effort, but you really do need to opt out of all four data brokers separately to get out of this program.</p><p><b>Acxiom</b></p><p>1. To get started, visit Acxiom's Opt Out Form. Then scroll down until you see your \"opt-out choices.\" Here there will be a list of the types of media you would like to opt out of (mail, telemarketing, email, and online advertising).  You can check all four, though note that their online advertising opt-out is cookie-based, meaning it will disappear every time you clear your cookies. </p><img src=\"tool_facebook11\"><p>2. Certify that you are just a single person.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook12\"><p>3. Fill out the form with your personal information. In order to be sure that Acxiom doesn't target advertisements at you through Facebook, you'll want to provide Acxiom with the phone number and email address associated with your Facebook profile. Use the green + signs on the form to add information.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook13\"><p>4. Click submit. After you hit submit (and get through a CAPTCHA), you'll be offered a chance to install Acxiom's opt out cookie. You can choose to do this or not, but remember that this is not a persistent method of protecting your privacy: the opt out cookie will disappear as soon as you clear your cookies. See instructions below for opting out of BlueKai for advice on dealing with web tracking.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook14\"><p>5.  You will then receive an email with a link in it from Acxiom. You can click on this link or else copy and paste it into a new browser window. Visiting this page will take you to another CAPTCHA. Fill this out.</p><p>Congratulations - you've opted out of Acxiom!</p><p><b>Datalogix</b></p><p>1. To opt out of this program, visit the Datalogix.com privacy page. Scroll down to the word “Choice” and the last sentence in the first paragraph says:</p><p><i>“If you wish to opt out of all Datalogix-enabled advertising across channels including direct mail, online, mobile and analytic products, click here.”</i></p><p>2. Click there and a form will pop up that asks for your name, address, and email address. Fill this out and click submit.</p><img src=\"tool_facebook15\"><p>Datalogix promises that the opt-out will take effect within 30 days. Once you’ve been opted out, Datalogix will no longer include your information in the hashed data they provide to Facebook. </p><p><b>Epsilon</b></p><p>As Epsilon explains on their Consumer Preference Center page, there are several ways to opt out of the Epsilon marketing database: </p><p><b>EMAIL:</b> Email optout@epsilon.com and include the following information:<br>· full name (including middle initial)<br>· current address<br>· previous address if you have been at your current address fewer than six months</p><p><b>PHONE:</b> Phone 1.888.780.3869 and leave the above information.</p><p><b>MAIL:</b> Mail the above information to the below addresses:<br><b>U.S. Consumers:</b> Epsilon<br>\u2028P.O. Box 1478<br>\u2028Broomfield, CO 80036<br><b>Canadian Consumers:</b> Epsilon\u2028<br>41 Metropolitan Rd.\u2028<br>Toronto, Ontario<br>\u2028M1R 2T5</p><p>We note that not all of these methods require you to provide an email address.  Epsilon may have methods to match your name with your email, but you can also provide your email address to be sure.</p><p>Note that opting out doesn't actually remove the data from Epsilon's database but rather just marks it as \"suppressed\" to they will stop sharing it for marketing purposes. This means that if the information is ever re-submitted, you won't be added back to the list.</p><p><b>BlueKai</b></p><p>Unlike the other data brokers Facebook is working with on this new project, BlueKai does not directly collect data from your offline activities. Instead, they use tracking cookies that collect data about your online browsing habits and then use that information to infer what types of products you might like to buy.</p><p><b>The best way to opt out of this is to use a browser add-on to block third-party tracking.</b><br>Rather than try to block only BlueKai, we recommend you block all third-party trackers. You can use a tool such as Ghostery (now available on Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer) as noted earlier.</p><p><b>CONGRATULATIONS</b> -- you've managed to get out of Facebook's new data broker-driven targeted marketing, and helped protect yourself from several important data brokers.  </p>\n"));
        segmentList.add(new Segment(40, 1, "<p>Some of the technical terms that you will encounter, as you read through Umbrella’s lessons, are defined below:</p><p>· <b>Adversary</b>: Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the network at a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary is hypothetical.<br>· <b>Air gap</b>: A computer or network that is physically isolated from all other networks, including the Internet, is said to be air-gapped. <br>· <b>Android</b>: A Linux-based open-source operating system for smartphones and tablet devices, developed by Google.<br>· <b>Anti-virus</b>: Software that attempts to protect a device from being taken over by malicious software  (or “malware \"). \"Viruses' were some of the first and most prevalent forms of malware; they were named viruses to reflect the way they would spread from device to device. These days most antivirus software concentrate on warning you if you look to be downloading a suspicious file from an external source, and examining files on your computer to see if they match the software's idea of what malware looks like. Anti-virus software can only recognise malware if it is substantially similar to samples that the anti-virus developer has already analysed. This makes it far less effective at combating targeted malware designed to infiltrate a particular community or person, rather than more widespread strains of malware. Some advanced malware can also actively attack or conceal itself from antivirus software.<br>· <b>APG: Android Privacy Guard</b>: FOSS app for Android smartphones that facilitates OpenPGP encryption. It can be integrated with K9 Mail.<br>· <b> .apk file</b>: The file extension used for Android apps.<br>· <b>App Store</b>: The default repository from which iPhone applications can be found and downloaded.<br>· <b>Asset</b>: In threat modelling, any piece of data or a device that needs to be protected.<br>· <b>Attack</b>: In computer security, an attack is a method that can be used to compromise security, or its actual use. An attacker is the person or organization using an attack. An attack method is sometimes called an \"exploit.\"<br>Avast - A freeware anti-virus tool· <b>Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)</b>: The first and deepest level of software on a computer. The BIOS allows you to set many advanced preferences related to the computer's hardware, including a start-up password<br>· <b>BlackBerry</b>: A brand of smartphones which run the BlackBerry operating system developed by Research In Motion (RIM).<br>· <b>Blacklist</b>: A list of blocked websites and other Internet services that can not be accessed due to a restrictive filtering policy<br>· <b>Bluetooth</b>: A physical wireless communications standard for exchanging data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices. Bluetooth uses short wavelength radio transmissions.<br>· <b>Booting</b>: The act of starting up a computer<br>· <b>Burner phone</b>: A phone that is not connected to your identity, is only used for a small set of calls or activities, and can be discarded if and when it is suspected of being tracked or compromised. Burner phones are often pre-paid mobile phones bought with cash.<br>· <b>CCleaner</b>: A freeware tool that removes temporary files and potentially sensitive traces left on your hard drive by programs that you have used recently and by the Windows operating system itself<br>· <b>CD Burner</b>: A computer CD-ROM drive that can write data on blank CDs. DVD burners can do the same with blank DVDs. CD-RW *and *DVD-RW drives can delete and rewrite information more than once on the same CD-RW or DVD-RW disc.<br>· <b>Circumvention</b>: The act of bypassing Internet filters to access blocked websites and other Internet services<br>· <b>Clam Win</b>: A FOSS Anti-virus program for Windows<br>· <b>Cobian Backup</b>: A FOSS backup tool. The most recent version of Cobian is closed-source freeware, but prior versions are released as FOSS.<br>· <b>Command line tool</b>: The \"command line\" is an ancient way of giving a computer a series of small, self-contained orders (think of those science fiction movies where teenage geniuses type long strings of green text onto black screens). To use a command line tool, the user types a command into a window called a terminal emulator, hits the return or enter key, and then receives a textual response in the same window. Windows, Linux and Apple desktop computers still let you run software using this interface, and even some mobile phones can do the same with the right app. The command line can be used to run software pre-packaged with your operating system. Some downloadable programs, especially technical utilities, use the command line instead of a more familiar \"icons and buttons\" user interface. The command line needn't be scary, but it does require you to type in exactly the right set of letters and numbers to get the correct result, and it's often unclear what to do if the responses don't match your expectations.<br>· <b>Commercial VPN</b>: A commercial Virtual Private Network is a private service that offers to securely relay your Internet communications via their own network. The advantage of this is that all of the data you send and receive is hidden from local networks, so it is safer from nearby criminals, or untrusted local ISPs or cybercafés. A VPN may be hosted in a foreign country, which is useful both for protecting communications from a local government, and bypassing national censorship. The down side is that most of the traffic is decrypted at the commercial VPN 's end. That means you need to trust the commercial VPN (and the country where it is located) not to snoop on your traffic.<br>· <b>Comodo Firewall</b>: A freeware firewall tool<br>· <b>Cookie</b>: A small file, saved on your computer by your browser, that can be used to store information for, or identify you to, a particular website<br>· <b>Corporate Intranet</b>: Companies and other large institutions will usually have some services (email, web, and access to files and printers for instance) that are accessible from within their own local network, but not from outside on the wider Internet. Most companies take this as being sufficient security to protect their internal documents, but this means that any attack that can connect to the intranet can access or interfere with all the information being kept locally. An example of such an attack is tricking an employee to install malware on their laptop. To allow employees to access the intranet via the wider Internet, companies will often provide their own Virtual Private Network  (VPN) which creates a secure connection to the inside of the intranet from anywhere in the world.<br>· <b>Cryptography</b>: The art of designing secret codes or ciphers that let you send and receive messages to a recipient without others being able to understand the message.<br>· <b>Cryptonite</b>: A FOSS app for file encryption on Android smartphones.<br>· <b>Decrypt</b>: Make a secret message or data intelligible. The idea behind encryption is to make messages that can only be decrypted by the person or people who are meant to receive them.<br>· <b>Digital signature</b>: A way of using encryption to prove that a particular file or message was truly sent by the person who claims to have sent it<br>· <b>Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS)</b>: A method for taking a website or other Internet service offline, by co-ordinating many different computers to request or send data to it simultaneously. Usually the computers used to conduct such an attack are remotely controlled by criminals, who have taken over the machines by breaking into them, or infecting them with malware.<br>· <b>Domain name: The address, in words, of a website or Internet service; for example</b>: www.google.com<br>· <b>EDGE, GPRS, UMTS</b>: Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution, General Packet Radio Service, and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System – technologies which allow mobile devices to connect to the internet.<br>· <b>Encryption</b>: A way of using clever mathematics to encrypt, or scramble, information so that it can only be decrypted and read by someone who has a particular piece of information, such as a password or an encryption key<br>· <b>Encryption key</b>: An encryption key is a piece of information that is used to convert a message into an unreadable form. In some cases, you need the same encryption key to decode the message. In others, the encryption key and decryption key are different.<br>· <b>End-to-end encryption</b>: End-to-end encryption ensures that a message is turned into a secret message by its original sender, and decoded only by its final recipient. Other forms of encryption may depend on encryption performed by third parties. That means that those parties have to be trusted with the original text. End-to-end encryption is generally regarded as safer, because it reduces the number of parties who might be able to interfere or break the encryption.<br>· <b>Enigmail</b>: An add-on for the Thunderbird email program that allows it to send and receive encrypted and digitally signed email<br>· <b>Eraser</b>: A tool that securely and permanently deletes information from your computer or removable storage device<br>· <b>F-Droid</b>: An alternative repository from which many FOSS Android applications can be found and downloaded.<br>· <b>File system</b>: Where data is stored, usually locally, on your computer or other device. File systems are usually where personal documents and notes are stored for easy access.<br>· <b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP server)</b>: An old method for copying files from a local computer to a remote one, or vice versa. The job of FTP programs (and the FTP servers that stored the files) has mostly been replaced by web browsers and web servers, or file synchronising programs like Dropbox.<br>Firefox - A popular FOSS Web browser that provides an alternative to Microsoft Internet ExplorerFirewall - A tool that protects your computer from untrusted connections to or from local networks and the Internet· <b>Forward secrecy</b>: A property of a secure messaging system which ensures that your past communications can remain secure even if one of the private keys is stolen later. For HTTPS websites, forward secrecy is an important protection against adversaries like intelligence agencies that may record large amounts of traffic and use a stolen key to decrypt it. For instant messaging and chat systems, forward secrecy is necessary to ensure that deleted messages are really deleted, but you will also need to either [disabled logging] or [securely delete past messages].<br>· <b>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</b>: This family of software is available free of charge and has no legal restrictions to prevent a user from testing, sharing or modifying it<br>· <b>Freeware</b>: Includes software that is free of charge but subject to legal or technical restrictions that prevent users from accessing the source code used to create it<br>· <b>Full disk encryption</b>: If you're planning on securing data on your local device, you could choose to just encrypt a few key files, or you could encrypt everything on the computer. “Full disk encryption ” is the term for encrypting everything. It's usually safer (and often easier) to use full disk encryption than to manage just a few individually encrypted files. If you try to encrypt just individual files, your computer might make temporary unencrypted copies of those files without you noticing. And some software might keep some unencrypted records about your use of your computer. Apple's OS X, Linux and high-end versions of Windows all have built-in full disk encryption, but it is usually not turned on by default.<br>· <b>Gibberbot</b>: A FOSS app for Android that facilitates secure chats over XMPP protocol (used also by Google Talk). It is compatible with Off-the-Record and, when used in conjunction with Orbot, can route chats through the Tor network.<br>· <b>Google Play</b>: The default repository from which Android applications can be found and downloaded.<br>· <b>GNU/Linux</b>: A FOSS operating system that provides an alternative to Microsoft Windows<br>· <b>Global Positioning System (GPS)</b>: A space-based global navigation satellite system that provides location and time information in all weather, anywhere on or near the Earth, where there is an (almost) unobstructed sky view.<br>· <b>Guardian Project</b>: An organisation that creates smartphone apps, mobile devices operating system enhancements and customisations with privacy and security in mind.<br>· <b>Hacker</b>: In this context, a malicious computer criminal who may be trying to access your sensitive information or take control of your computer remotely<br>· <b>HTTPS</b>: If you've ever seen a web address spelled out as “http://www.example.com/”, you'll recognize the “http” bit of this term. HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is the way a web browser on your machine talks to a remote web server. Unfortunately, standard http sends text insecurely across the Internet. HTTPS (the S stands for “secure”) uses encryption to better protect the data you send to websites, and the information they return to you, from prying eyes.<br>· <b>IMAP settings</b>: IMAP is the way that many email programs communicates with services that send, receive and store your email. By changing the IMAP settings on your email program, you can choose to load email from different servers or set the level of security and encryption used to transfer the mail across the Internet to you.<br>· <b>Indicators of compromise</b>: Clues that show that your device may have been broken into or tampered with.<br>· <b>Internet filtering</b>: Filtering is the politer term for blocking or censoring Internet traffic.<br>· <b>IP address</b>: A device on the Internet needs its own address to receive data, just like a home or business needs a street address to receive physical mail. This address is its IP (Internet Protocol) address. When you connect to a web site or other server online, you usually reveal your own IP address. This doesn't necessarily reveal either your identity (it's hard to map an IP address to a real address or a particular computer). An IP address can give away some information about you, however, such as your rough location or the name of your Internet Service Provider. Services like Tor let you hide your IP address, which helps give you anonymity online.<br>· <b>iPhone</b>: A brand of smartphones designed by Apple that run the Apple's iOS operating system.<br>· <b>Internet Protocol address (IP address)</b>: A unique identifier assigned to your computer when it is connected to the Internet<br>· <b>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</b>: The company or organisation that provides your initial link to the Internet. The governments of many countries exert control over the Internet, using means such as filtering and surveillance, through the ISPs that operate in those countries.<br>· <b>Infrared Data Association (IrDA)</b>: A physical wireless communications standard for the short-range exchange of data using infrared spectrum light. IrDA is replaced by Bluetooth in modern devices.<br>· <b>Java Applications (Applets)</b>: Small programs that can run under many operating systems and are cross-platform. They are frequently used to provide improved functionalities within web pages.<br>· <b>Jailbreaking</b>: The process of unlocking features on an iPhone, which are otherwise blocked, by the manufacturer or mobile carrier in order to gain full access to the operating system.<br>· <b>K9 Mail</b>: A FOSS e-mail client for Android smartphones, which enables OpenPGP encryption when used with the APG app.<br>· <b>Key</b>: In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to encrypt or decrypt a message.<br>· <b>Key logger</b>: A type of spyware that records which keys you have typed on your computer's keyboard and send this information to a third party. Key loggers are frequently used to steal email and other passwords.<br>· <b>Key pair</b>: To receive encrypted messages using public key cryptography  (and to reliably inform others that a message genuinely came from you), you need to create two keys. One, the private key, you keep secret. The other, the public key, you can let anyone see. The two keys are connected mathematically, and are often collectively known as a \"key pair\".<br>· <b>KeePass</b>: A freeware secure password database<br>· <b>Keyring: If you use public key cryptography, you'll need to keep track of many keys</b>: your secret, private key, your public key, and the public keys of everyone you communicate with. The collection of these keys is often referred to as your key ring.<br>· <b>Key-signing party: When you're using public key encryption, it's important to be sure that the key you use to encrypt a message really belongs to the recipient (see key verification). PGP makes this a little easier by having a way to tell others \"I believe this key belongs to this person -- and if you trust me, you should believe that too.\" Telling the world that you trust someone's key is called \"signing their key\"</b>: it means anyone who uses that key can see you vouched for it. To encourage everyone to check and sign each other’s keys, PGP users organize key-signing parties. They're almost, but not quite, as exciting as they sound.<br>· <b>Key verification</b>: In public key cryptography, each person has a set of keys. To send a message securely to a particular person, you encrypt your message using their public key. An attacker may be able to trick you into using their key, which means that they will be able to read your message, instead of the intended recipient. That means that you have to verify that a particular person is using a key. Key verification is any way that lets you match a key to a person.<br>· <b>LiveCD</b>: A CD that allows your computer to run a different operating system temporarily.<br>· <b>Malware</b>: A general term for all malicious software, including viruses, spyware, trojans, and other such threats<br>· <b>Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)</b>: Suppose you believe you were speaking to your friend, Bahram, via encrypted instant messenger. To check it's really him, you ask him to tell you the city where you first met. \"Istanbul\" comes the reply. That's correct! Unfortunately, without you or Bahram knowing, someone else online has been intercepting all your communications. When you first connected to Bahram, you actually connected to this person, and she, in turn, connected to Bahram. When you think you are asking Bahram a question, she receives your message, relays the question to Bahram, receives his answer back, and then sends it to you. Even though you think you are communicating securely with Bahram, you are, in fact, only communicating securely with the spy, who is also communicating securely to Bahram! This is the man-in-the-middle attack. Men-in-the-middle can spy on communications or even insert false or misleading messages into your communications. Security-focused internet communications software needs to defend against the man-in-the-middle attack to be safe against attackers who have control of any part of the Internet between two communicators.<br>· <b>Master password</b>: A password used to unlock a store of other passwords or other ways to unlock programs or messages. You should make a master password as strong as you can.<br>· <b>Metadata: Metadata  (or \"data about data\") is everything about a piece of information, apart from the information itself. So the content of a message is not metadata, but who sent it, when, where from, and to whom, are all examples of metadata. Legal systems often protect content more than metadata</b>: for instance, in the United States, law enforcement needs a warrant to listen to a person's telephone calls, but claims the right to obtain the list of who you have called far more easily. However, metadata can often reveal a great deal, and will often need to be protected as carefully as the data it describes.<br>· <b>Mnemonic device</b>: A simple trick that can help you remember complex passwords<br>· <b>NoScript</b>: A security add-on for the Firefox browser that protects you from malicious programs that might be present in unfamiliar webpages<br>· <b>Obscuracam</b>: A FOSS app for Android smartphones, which protects identity of people by facilitating editions such as face blurring to photographs.<br>· <b>Off-the-Record (OTR)</b>: Instant messaging systems are often unencrypted. OTR is a way of adding encryption to them, so that you can keep using familiar networks like Facebook chat, Google Chat or Hangouts, or Microsoft Messenger, but with your messages more resistant to surveillance.<br>· <b>One-time password: Passwords are usually semi-permanent</b>: once you set them up, you can keep using them until you manually change or reset them. One-time passwords only work once. Some one-time password systems work by having a tool or program that can create many different one-time passwords, which you use in turn. This is useful if you're afraid that there may be a key -logger on a system where you have to type in a password.<br>· <b>Operating system</b>: A program that runs all the other programs on a computer. Windows, Android and Apple's OS X and iOS are all examples of operating systems.<br>· <b>Orbot</b>: A FOSS app for Android smartphones that enables apps such as Orweb and Gibberbot to connect to the Tor network.<br>· <b>Orweb</b>: A FOSS web browser for Android smartphones which, when used in conjunction with Orbot, facilitates browsing over the Tor network.<br>· <b>Out-of-band verification</b>: \"Out-of-band\" means any way of communicating outside of the current method. Verifying the identity of the person you're talking to over an insecure communication system often requires communicating out-of-band via another method that is less vulnerable to the same kind of attack. So, for instance, you might check that you are using someone's correct public key by talking to him or her in person, before using it to encrypt your email.<br>· <b>Passive adversary</b>: A passive adversary is one that can listen to your communications, but cannot directly tamper with them.<br>· <b>Passphrase</b>: A passphrase is a kind of password. We use \"passphrase\" to convey the idea that a password that is a single word is far too short to protect you and a longer phrase is much better. <br>· <b>Password manager</b>: A tool that can encrypt and store your passwords using a single master password making it practical to use many different passwords on different sites and services without having to memorize them.<br>· <b>Peacefire</b>: Subscribers to this free service receive periodical emails containing an updated list of circumvention proxies, which can be used to bypass Internet censorship<br>· <b>PGP</b>: PGP or Pretty Good Privacy was one of the first popular implementations of public key cryptography. Phil Zimmermann, its creator, wrote the program in 1991 to help activists and others protect their communications. The US government formally investigated him when the program spread outside the United States. At the time, exporting tools that included strong public key encryption was a violation of US law. PGP continues to exist as a commercial software product. A free implementation of the same underlying standard that PGP uses called GnuPG (or GPG) is also available. Because both use the same interchangeable approach, people will refer to using a “PGP key ” or sending a “PGP message”, even if they are using GnuPG.<br>· <b>Physical threat</b>: In this context, any threat to your sensitive information that results from other people having direct physical access your computer hardware or from other physical risks, such as breakage, accidents or natural disasters<br>· <b>Pidgin</b>: A FOSS instant messaging tool that supports an encryption plugin called Off the Record (OTR)<br>· <b>Proxy</b>: An intermediary service through which you can channel some or all of your Internet communication and that can be used to bypass Internet censorship. A proxy may be public, or you may need to log in with a username and password to access it. Only some proxies are secure, which means that they use encryption to protect the privacy of the information that passes between your computer and the Internet services to which you connect through the proxy.<br>· <b>Proprietary software</b>: The opposite of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS). These applications are usually commercial, but can also be freeware with restrictive license requirements.<br>· <b>Protocol: A communications protocol is a way of sending data between programs or computers. Software programs that use the same protocol can talk to each other</b>: so web browsers and web servers speak the same protocol, called \"http\". Some protocols use encryption to protect their contents. The secure version of the http protocol is called \"https \". Another example of an encrypted protocol used by many different programs is OTR  (Off-the-Record), a protocol for secure instant messaging.<br>· <b>Public key encryption: Traditional encryption systems use the same secret, or key, to encrypt and decrypt a message. So if I encrypted a file with the password \"bluetonicmonster\", you would need both the file and the secret \"bluetonicmonster\" to decode it. Public key encryption uses two keys: one to encrypt, and other to decrypt. This has all kinds of useful consequences. For one, it means that you can hand out the key to encrypt messages to you, and as long as you keep the other key secret, anyone with that key can talk to you securely. The key you hand out widely is known as the \"public key\"</b>: hence the name of the technique. Public key encryption is used to encrypt email and files by Pretty Good Privacy  (PGP), OTR for instant messaging, and SSL/TLS for web browsing.<br>· <b>Revocation certificate</b>: What happens if you lose access to a secret key, or it stops being secret? A revocation certificate is a file that you can generate that announces that you no longer trust that key. You generate it when you still have the secret key, and keep it for any future disaster.<br>· <b>RiseUp</b>: A email service run by and for activists that can be accessed securely either through webmail or using an email client such as Mozilla Thunderbird<br>· <b>Risk analysis</b>: In computer security, risk analysis is calculating the chance that threats might succeed, so you know how much effort to spend defending against them. There may be many different ways that you might lose control or access to your data, but some of them are less likely than others. Assessing risk means deciding which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about. <br>· <b>Rooting</b>: The process of unlocking features on an Android Phone which are otherwise blocked by the manufacturer or mobile carrier in order to gain full access to the operating system.<br>· <b>Router</b>: A piece of networking equipment through which computers connect to their local networks and through which various local networks access the Internet. Switches, gateways and hubs perform similar tasks, as do wireless access points for computers that are properly equipped to use them<br>· <b>Secure password database</b>: A tool that can encrypt and store your passwords using a single master password<br>· <b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</b>: The technology that permits you to maintain a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and some of the websites and Internet services that you visit. When you are connected to a website through SSL, the address of the website will begin with HTTPS rather than HTTP.<br>· <b>Security certificate</b>: A way for secure websites and other Internet services to prove, using encryption, that they are who they claim to be. In order for your browser to accept a security certificate as valid, however, the service must pay for a digital signature from a trusted organization. Because this costs money that some service operators are unwilling or unable to spend, however, you will occasionally see a security certificate error even when visiting a valid service.<br>· <b>Security question: To supplement passwords, some systems use \"security questions\". These are queries to which only you are supposed to know the answer. The problem with security questions is that they are really just extra passwords that have potentially guessable answers. We recommend you treat them as any other password</b>: create a long, novel, random, phrase to answer them, and record that somewhere safe. So the next time your bank asks you your mother's maiden name, you should be ready to answer \"Correct Battery Horse Staple\" or similar.<br>· <b>Security policy</b>: A written document that describes how your organization can best protect itself from various threats, including a list of steps to be taken should certain security-related events take place<br>· <b>Security cable</b>: A locking cable that can be used to secure a laptop or other piece of hardware, including external hard drives and some desktop computers, to a wall or a desk in order to prevent it from being physically removed<br>· <b>Server</b>: A computer that remains on and connected to the Internet in order to provide some service, such as hosting a webpage or sending and receiving email, to other computers<br>· <b>SIM card</b>: A small, removable card that can be inserted into a mobile phone in order to provide service with a particular mobile phone company. SIM cards can also store phone numbers and text messages.<br>· <b>Skype</b>: A freeware Voice over IP (VoIP) tool that allows you to speak with other Skype users for free and to call telephones for a fee. The company that maintains Skype claims that conversations with other Skype users are encrypted. Because it is a closed-source tool, there is no way to verify this claim, but many people believe it to be true. Skype also supports instant messaging.<br>· <b>SMTP settings</b>: SMTP is one method for sending mail between computers. You can configure most email programs to encrypt messages between your e-mail software and the email server by changing your programs' SMTP settings  (as long as your email service supports it)<br>· <b>Solid State Drive (SSD)</b>: Historically, computers stored data on rotating magnetic discs. Mobile devices and increasing numbers of personal computers now store permanent data on non-moving drives. These SSD drives are currently more expensive, but much faster than magnetic storage. Unfortunately, it can be more difficult to reliably and permanently remove data from SSD drives.<br>· <b>SSH</b>: SSH (or Secure SHell) is a method for letting you securely control a remote computer via a command line interface. One of the features of the SSH protocol is that as well as sending commands, you can also use it to securely relay Internet traffic between two computers. To set up an ssh link, the remote system needs to operate as a ssh server, and your local machine need an ssh client program.<br>· <b>Source code</b>: The underlying code, written by computer programmers, that allows software to be created. The source code for a given tool will reveal how it works and whether it may be insecure or malicious.<br>· <b>Spybot</b>: A freeware anti-malware tool that scans for, removes and helps protect your computer from spyware<br>· <b>Steganography</b>: Any method of disguising sensitive information so that it appears to be something else, in order to avoid drawing unwanted attention to it<br>· <b>Swap file</b>: A file on your computer to which information, some of which may be sensitive, is occasionally saved in order to improve performance<br>· <b>Terminal</b>: In ancient computer history, a terminal was a dedicated system of keyboard and screen that connected a user to a server. These days, it's more likely to be a program that allows you to talk to computers (either local or remote) over the command line.<br>· <b>Textsecure</b>: A FOSS app for Android that facilitates encrypted sending and storage of text messages.<br>· <b>Thunderbird</b>: A FOSS email program with a number of security features, including support for the Enigmail encryption add-on<br>· <b>Threat</b>: In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to defend your data. Threats can be intentional (conceived by attackers), or they could be accidental (you might leave your computer turned on and unguarded).<br>· <b>Threat model</b>: A way of narrowly thinking about the sorts of protection you want for your data. It's impossible to protect against every kind of trick or attacker, so you should concentrate on which people might want your data, what they might want from it, and how they might get it. Coming up with a set of possible attacks you plan to protect against is called threat modelling. Once you have a threat model, you can conduct a risk analysis.<br>· <b>Throwaway address</b>: An email address you use once, and never again. Used to sign up to Internet services without revealing an email address connected to your identity.<br>· <b>Tor</b>: An anonymity tool that allows you to bypass Internet censorship and hide the websites and Internet services you visit from anyone who may be monitoring your Internet connection, while also disguising your own location from those websites<br>· <b>Traffic-blocking browser extension</b>: When you visit a website, your browser sends some information to that site's operators -- your IP address, other information about your computer, and cookies that link you to previous visits using that browser, for instance. If the website includes images and content taken from other web servers, that same information is sent to other websites as part of downloading or viewing the page. Advertising networks, analytics providers, and other data collectors may gather information from you in this way. You can install additional software that runs alongside your browser and will limit how much information is leaked to third parties in this way. The most well known examples are programs that block advertisements. EFF offers a tool called Privacy Badger that is another traffic-blocking extension.<br>· <b>Transport encryption</b>: Encrypting data as it travels across the network, so that others spying on the network cannot read it.<br>· <b>Two-factor authentication</b>: \"Something you know, and something you have.\" Login systems that require only a username and password risk being broken when someone else can obtain (or guess) those pieces of information. Services that offer two-factor authentication also require providing a separate confirmation that you are who you say you are. The second factor could be a one-off secret code, a number generated by a program running on a mobile device, or a device that you carry and that you can use to confirm who you are. Companies like banks, and major internet services like Google, PayPal and Twitter now offer two-factor authentication.<br>· <b>TrueCrypt</b>: A FOSS file encryption tool that allows you to store sensitive information securely<br>· <b>Undelete Plus</b>: A freeware tool that can sometimes restore information that you may have deleted accidentally<br>· <b>Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS)</b>: A piece of equipment that allows your critical computing hardware to continue operating, or to shut down gracefully, in the event of a brief loss of power<br>· <b>VautletSuite 2 Go</b>: A Freeware encrypted email program<br>· <b>Virtual Private Network</b>: A virtual private network is a method for connecting your computer securely to the network of an organization on the other side of the Internet. When you use a VPN, all of your computer's Internet communications is packaged together, encrypted and then relayed to this other organization, where it is decrypted, unpacked, and then sent on to its destination. To the organization's network, or any other computer on the wider Internet, it looks like your computer's request is coming from inside the organization, not from your location. VPNs are used by businesses to provide secure access to internal resources (like file servers or printers). They are also used by individuals to bypass local censorship, or defeat local surveillance.<br>· <b>Voice over IP (VoIP)</b>: The technology that allows you to use the Internet for voice communication with other VoIP users and telephones<br>· <b>Web browser</b>: The program you use to view web sites. Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Chrome are all web browsers. Smartphones have a built-in web browser app for the same purpose<br>· <b>Web-based proxy</b>: A website that lets its users access other, blocked or censored websites. Generally, the web proxy will let you type a web address (or URL) onto a web page, and then redisplay that web address on the proxy page. Easier to use than most other censorship-circumventing services.<br>· <b>Whitelist</b>: A list of websites or Internet services to which some form of access is permitted, when other sites are automatically blocked<br>· <b>Windows Phone</b>: A smartphone operating system developed by Microsoft.<br>· <b>Wiping</b>: The process of deleting information securely and permanently<br>· <b>XMPP</b>: An open standard for instant messages - Google uses XMPP for Google Chat; Facebook used to offer it, but stopped. Non-corporate independent instant messaging services will usually use XMPP. Services like WhatsApp have their own, closed and secret protocol.<br>· <b>Your-Freedom</b>: A freeware circumvention tool that allows you to bypass filtering by connecting to the Internet through a private proxy. If Your-Freedom is configured properly, your connection to these proxies will be encrypted in order to protect the privacy of your communication.<br>· <b>Zero day</b>: A flaw in a piece of software or hardware that was previously unknown to the maker of the product. Until the manufacturers hear of the flaw and fix it, attackers can use it for their own purposes.</p>"));
