In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any App Store Terms, the App Store Terms will prevail. You and we acknowledge and agree that the relevant App Store Provider is a third party beneficiary under these Terms and will have the right to enforce these Terms against you directly.</p><p>We and our service providers are responsible for any maintenance and support of the App and you acknowledge that any App Store Provider from whom you download the App is not under any obligation to you to carry out any maintenance and/or support for the App itself. You acknowledge that we are under no obligation to carry out maintenance and/or support of the App and do so entirely at our discretion.</p><p>These Terms apply to the App including any updates or supplements to the App, unless such updates or supplements are accompanied by separate terms, in which case those terms apply. We may change these Terms at any time by notifying you of a change when you next start the App. The updated Terms will be displayed on-screen and you will be required to agree to them to continue your use of the App. The date these Terms were last updated appears at the bottom of these Terms.</p><p>From time to time we may issue updates to the App. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the App until you have downloaded and installed the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms. Some updates may not be available to certain models of device. In order to use the App, you may be required to obtain certain updates and/or upgrades to your device. You are responsible for any costs and/or fees associated with any such updates/upgrades. You also understand and accept that: (a) the device you use to access the App will require certain software in order for the App to work correctly and it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the required up-to-date software, and (b) the App has not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the functionality of the App meets your requirements.</p><p>You may only download and install the App onto a device that you own, or if you do not own the device, you must have the permission from the owner(s) to do so. You accept responsibility under these Terms for the use of the App, whether or not you own the device onto which the App is downloaded and installed. You also acknowledge that the owner(s) of the device onto which the App is installed may be charged by any relevant mobile network operator and/or internet service provider in relation to any data and/or mobile connectivity used by the App.</p><p>Access to the App may be suspended temporarily and without notice: (a) in the case of system failure, (b) for maintenance or repair, (c) where we reasonably suspect there has been a breach of these Terms, (d) for reasons beyond our control, or (e) as otherwise explained in these Terms.</p><big><b>PERMITTED USE AND RESTRICTIONS</b></big><p>In consideration of you agreeing to abide by these Terms, we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive licence (i.e. permission) to use the App subject to these Terms. We reserve all other rights, which are not granted in these Terms. You may download and install the App through authorised App Store Providers only, and you may view, use and display the App for your personal purposes only.</p><p>Except as explained in these Terms or as permitted by any local law, you agree: (a) not to copy the App except where such copying is incidental to normal use of the App, or where it is necessary for the purpose of back-up, (b) not to rent, lease, sub-license (i.e. grant anyone else the permission to use the App), loan, translate, merge, adapt, vary or modify the App (or any part of it), (c) not to, nor attempt to, disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer or create derivative works based on the whole or any part of the App, and (d) not to provide or otherwise make available the App in whole or in part in any form to any person without prior written consent from us. Notwithstanding the above, the use, reproduction and distribution of components of the App licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not these Terms. </p><p>You must not use the App: (a) in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or to act fraudulently or maliciously, for example, by hacking into or inserting malicious code, including viruses, or harmful data, into the App or any operating system used by the App, (b) in a way that could damage, disable, overburden, impair or compromise our systems or security or interfere with other users, (c) to collect or harvest any information or data from the App or our systems or attempt to decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the App, (d) to send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not comply with these Terms, or (e) to transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar solicitation (spam).</p><big><b>SECURITY AND PASSWORDS</b></big><p>If you create a password or any other authentication information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential.

We are not responsible for any losses or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any unauthorised use of the App. </p><p>We have the right to disable any password or other authentication information whether chosen by you or allocated by us, at any time, if in our reasonable opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms. In the event that you forget your password you may be required to delete the App, reinstall it and set up a new password in order to regain access to the App. Alternatively, if your password was provided by GSF, you may be able to notify us of its loss by email and we may be able to reset it.</p><big><b>YOUR PROMISES TO US</b></big><p>You promise to us that: (a) you are authorised to agree to these Terms, (b) you are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties, (c) you are not subject to and do not work for any company, organisation or other body that is subject to any United States, European Union or United Nations sanction, (d) you will not use the App for the purposes of or in connection with any act of terrorism or any other unlawful act, (e) any information submitted by you shall be at your own risk, and (f) you will not disclose nor allow to be disclosed by any means any confidential information belonging to us that you become aware of.</p><big><b>PRIVACY</b></big><p>These Terms also incorporate the terms of our privacy policy (as updated from time to time), which is available from within the App and on our website at https://secfirst.org/legal.html (the “Privacy Policy”) unless any element of the App is subject to a separate privacy policy, which we notify to you.
